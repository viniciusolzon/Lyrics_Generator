lyric
"This is the first line here
This is the first line again
Watch as it disappears
I know the last line
The last line will never pull me in

This is the next line here
This is the next line again
You can forget I'm here
As if the last line
The last line is slowly closing in

This is the last line here
This is the last line again
Watch as I disappear
And the last line
The flat line, it goes here at the end"
"Why does it feel like night today?
Something in here's not right today.
Why am I so uptight today?
Paranoia's all I got left

I don't know what stressed me first
Or how the pressure was fed
But I know just what it feels like
To have a voice in the back of my head

Like a face that I hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face that watches every time I lie
A face that laughs every time I fall
(And watches everything)

So I know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is here in me
Right underneath my skin


It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin


I know I've got a face in me
Points out all my mistakes to me
You've got a face on the inside too
Your paranoia's probably worse

I don't know what set me off first
But I know what I can't stand
Everybody acts like the fact of the matter
Is I can't add up to what you can

But everybody has a face that they hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face that watches every time they lie
A face that laughs every time they fall
(And watches everything)

So you know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is watching you too
Right inside your skin


It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath the skin

It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin


The face inside is right beneath the skin [3x]


The sun goes down
I feel the light betray me
The sun goes down
I feel the light betray me

The sun
(It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back)
(It's like a whirlwind inside of my head)
(It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within)
(It's like the face inside is right beneath the skin)
I feel the light betray me

The sun
(It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back)
(It's like a whirlwind inside of my head)
(It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within)
(It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within)
I feel the light betray me
(It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within)
The sun
(It's like the face inside is right beneath my skin)"
"Water grey
Through the windows, up the stairs
Chilling rain
Like an ocean everywhere

Don't wanna reach for me, do you?
I mean nothing to you
The little things give you away

And now there will be no mistaking
The levees are breaking

All you've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you
And six feet under water
I do

Hope decays
Generations disappear
Washed away
As a nation simply stares

Don't wanna reach for me, do you?
I mean nothing to you
The little things give you away

But now there will be no mistaking
The levees are breaking

All you've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you
And six feet under water
I do

All you've ever wanted
Was someone to truly look up to you
And six feet under ground now Iâ
Now I do

[Brad's guitar solo]

Little things give you away [4x]

All you've ever wanted (little things give you away)
Was someone to truly look up to you (little things give you away)"
"The cycle repeated
As explosions broke in the sky
All that I needed
Was the one thing I couldn't find

And you were there at the turn
Waiting to let me know

We're building it up
To break it back down
We're building it up
To burn it down
We can't wait
To burn it to the ground

The colors conflicted
As the flames climbed into the clouds
I wanted to fix this
But couldn't stop from tearing it down

And you were there at the turn
Caught in the burning glow
And I was there at the turn
Waiting to let you know

We're building it up
To break it back down
We're building it up
To burn it down
We can't wait
To burn it to the ground

You told me, ""Yes,""
You held me high
And I believed when you told that lie
I played soldier, you played king
And struck me down, when I kissed that ring
You lost that right, to hold that crown
I built you up, but you let me down
So when you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames
As your blazes burn

And you were there at the turn
Waiting to let me know

We're building it up
To break it back down
We're building it up
To burn it down
We can't wait
To burn it to the ground

When you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames
As your blazes burn

We can't wait
To burn it to the ground

When you fall, I'll take my turn
And fan the flames
As your blazes burn

We can't wait
To burn it to the ground"
"I don't mind stealing bread
From the mouths of decadence
But I can't feed on the powerless
When my cup's already overfilled.
But it's on the table
The fire is cooking
And they're farming babies
While slaves are working.
Blood is on the table
And the mouths are choking.
But I'm growing hungry

I don't mind stealing bread
From the mouths of decadence
But I can't feed on the powerless
When my cup's already overfilled.
But it's on the table

And they're farming babies
While the slaves are all working.
And it's on the table
The mouths are choking.
But I'm growing hungry

"A fire needs a space to burn
A breath to build a glow
I've heard it said a thousand times
But now I know

That you don't know what you've got
Oh you don't know what you've got
No you don't know what you've got
Until it's gone
Until it's gone
Until it's gone

I thought I kept you safe and sound
I thought I made you strong
But something made me realize
That I was wrong

'Cause finding what you got sometimes
Means finding it alone
And I can finally see your light
When I let go

'Cause you don't know what you've got
Until it's gone
Until it's gone
Until it's gone

Until it's gone
Until it's gone
Until it's gone
Until it's gone
Until it's gone

'Cause you don't know what you've got
Oh you don't know what you've got
No you don't know what you've got
It's your battle to be fought
No you don't know what you've got
'Til it's gone
'Til it's gone
'Til it's gone"
"Where should I start
Disjointed heart
I've got no commitment
To my own flesh and blood
Left all alone
Far from my home
No one to hear me, to heal my ill heart, I

Keep it locked up inside

Cannot express
To the point I've regressed
If anger's a gift, then I guess I've been blessed, I

Keep it locked up inside
Keep my distance from your lies

It's too late to love me now
You have never shown me
It's too late to love me now
You don't even know me

Breaking a part of my heart to find release
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace
Breaking a part of my heart to find release
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace

Breaking a part of my heart to find release (Break)
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace (Me)
Breaking a part of my heart to find release (Too)
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace

Keep it locked up inside
Keep my distance from your lies

Breaking a part of my heart to find release (Break)
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace (Me)
Breaking a part of my heart to find release (Too)
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace
Breaking a part of my heart to find release
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace
Breaking a part of my heart to find release
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace

Keep my distance
Keep my distance
Keep my distance
Keep my distance

Spit drips from the jaw of the witless witness
Cryptic colloquialisms shift your mid rift
Dog-paddle through a bog of shadows and smog
With my thought catalog, analog, rap battle log
Keep my distance, and fear resistance, hurt by persistence
The twisted web of tangled lies strangles my hope to waste and numbs the taste
And I'm forced to face these hate crimes against the state of being, feeling the weightlessness, press me to the ceiling, reeling around rooms, riding a bubble of sound
Tuned to the frequency making your chest shake with every boom, involuntary muscle contraction
Ignoring your neck's breaking, musical gas fume euphoria
The sound pounds to make the dead flush
To hand you a head rush with read rhymes and said stuff"
"[2x]
God bless us everyone,
We're a broken people living under loaded gun.
And it can't be outfought,
It can't be outdone,
It can't be outmatched,
It can't be outrun.
No!

And when I close my eyes tonight,
To symphonies of blinding light!

God bless us everyone,
We're a broken people living under loaded gun.
Oh!

Like memories in cold decay,
Transmissions echoing away,
Far from the world of you and I,
Where oceans bleed into the sky!

[2x]
God save us everyone,
Will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns?
For the sins of our hands,
The sins of our tongues,
The sins of our fathers,
The sins of our young.
No!

And when I close my eyes tonight,
To symphonies of blinding light!

God save us everyone,
Will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns?

Ooh!

Lift me up,
Let me go.
Leave it up,
Tell me ""No""."
"Drop that
Get up
Take to the streets
Better lock that kid up
Face full of teeth when he hock that spit up
Pacing the beat like a beast
Rocking the block on repeat
Speak from the cut like a rush of blood
Paint red on the sleeves of the ones you love
Lay the sick ones down and the bells will ring
Put pennies on the eyes let the dead men sing


I shiver and shake the warm air cold
I'm alone on my own
In every mistake I dig this hole
Through my skin and bones

It's harder starting over
Than never to have changed

With blackbirds following me
I'm digging out my grave
They close in, swallowing me
The pain, it comes in waves
I'm getting back what I gave

I sweat through the sheet as daylight fades
As I waste away
It traps me inside mistakes I've made
That's the price I pay

It's harder starting over
Than never to have changed

With blackbirds following me
I'm digging out my grave
They close in, swallowing me
The pain, it comes in waves
I'm getting back what I gave


I drop to the floor like I did before
Stop watching
I'm coughing
I can't be more
What I want and what I need are at constant war
Like a well full of poison a rotten core
The blood goes thin
The fever stings
And I shake from the hell that the habits bring
Lay the sick ones down
The bells will ring
Put pennies on the eyes
Let the dead men sing


Blackbirds following me
I'm digging out my grave
They close in, swallowing me
The pain, it comes in waves
I'm getting back what I gave

I'm getting back what I gave

"Graffiti decorations
Under a sky of dust
A constant wave of tension
On top of broken trust
The lessons that you taught me
I learn were never true
Now I find myself in question
(They point the finger at me again)
Guilty by association
(You point the finger at me again)


I wanna run away
Never say goodbye
I wanna know the truth
Instead of wondering why
I wanna know the answers
No more lies
I wanna shut the door
And open up my mind


Paper bags and angry voices
Under a sky of dust
Another wave of tension
Has more than filled me up
All my talk of taking action
These words were never true
Now I find myself in question
(They point the finger at me again)
Guilty by association
(You point the finger at me again)


I wanna run away
Never say goodbye
I wanna know the truth
Instead of wondering why
I wanna know the answers
No more lies

And open up my mind

When I pretend everything is what I want it to be
I look exactly like what you had always wanted to see

Stealing second after second just 'cause I know I can

Yeah, if you feeling like a pimp nigga
Go and brush your shoulders off
Ladies is pimps too
Go and brush your shoulders off
Niggaz is crazy, baby, don't forget that, boy
Told you get that dirt off your shoulder

I probably owe it to y'all
Proud to be locked by the force
Trying to hustle some things
That go with the Porsche

Feeling no remorse
Feeling like my hand was forced
Middle finger to the law
Nigga gripping my balls

Said the ladies they love me
From the bleachers they screaming
All the ballers is bouncing
They like the way I be leaning

All the rappers be hating
Off the track that I'm making
But all the hustlersâthey love it
Just to see one of us make it

Came from the bottom the bottom
To the top of the pops
Nigga London, Japan
And I'm straight off the block

Like a running back, get it man
I'm straight off the block
I can run it back, nigga
'Cause I'm straight with the Roc

If you feeling like a pimp, nigga
Go and brush your shoulders off
Ladies is pimps too
Go and brush your shoulders off
Niggaz is crazy, baby, don't forget that, boy
Told you get that dirt off your shoulder

You gotta get (get) that (that) dirt off your shoulder
You gotta get (get) that (that) dirt off your shoulder

Your homey Hov' in position
In the kitchen with soda
I just whipped up a watch
Trying to get me a Rover

Trying to stretch out the coca
Like a wrestler, yes, sir
Keep the Heckler close
You know them smokers'll test ya

But like fifty-two cards went out
I'm through dealing
Now fifty-two bars come out
Now you feel 'em
Now fifty-two cars roll out
Remove ceiling
In case fifty-two broads come out
Now you chilling
With a boss,
bitch, of course
S.C. on the sleeve
At the 40/40 club
ESPN on the screen

I paid a grip for the jeans
Plus the slippers is clean
No chrome on the wheels
I'm a grown-up for real, chill


Yeah, I remember what they taught to me
Remember condescending talk of who I ought to be
Remember listening to all of that and this again
So I pretended up a person who was fitting in

And now you think this person really is me
And I'm (trying to bend the truth)
But the more I push the more I'm pulling away
'Cause I'm (lying my way from you)

I wanna be pushed aside, so, let me go

Let me take back my life
I'd rather be all alone

Anywhere on my own

"Wake in a sweat again
Another day's been laid to waste
In my disgrace
Stuck in my head again
Feels like I'll never leave this place
There's no escape

I'm my own worst enemy

I've given up
I'm sick of feeling
Is there nothing you can say?
Take this all away
I'm suffocating
Tell me what the fuck is wrong with me?

I don't know what to take
Thought I was focused but I'm scared
I'm not prepared
I hyperventilate
Looking for help somehow somewhere
And no one cares

I'm my own worst enemy

I've given up
I'm sick of feeling

Punks on the block
Supposed to be close
But I swear right now
They close to be not

Put em on, bring em on

On with their the bongs
They be hopin' I pop
You open the knot
You openly admittin' you not
You openly be spittin' shit you don't be givin' a lot
You all be givers givin' these women the rings and the style

My vision of rock, my vision is caught
Killer cobra, N'est-ce pas
Feel us a who, feel'a real is enough

I'll slaughter all your borders you trust
They won't be carryin' your orders automatically dust
I'm automatically rush, plus grammatically tough
Trust the elephant tusk, trunk, and go for the top
Punk, who want it?
I'm guaranteed to get it and flaunt it
I'm playin' Buckley as my intro and I exit on ballin'


Skin to bone / steel to rust
Ash to ashes / dust to dust
Will tomorrow have it's way
With the promises we made
Skin to bone / steel to rustâ¦


You can't stop it, all you can do it watch it while it's happenin'
Like a tragic accident, rappers go and get your coffin
Skin to bone, the high raw biff of this rap shit
My legacy set in stone, fo' sho' no asterisk
Concept immaculate, start to finish
I'm Lil Wayne's dentist, looking at platinum plaques I'm gettin'
It's not an accident you flew off the roof
You said you was fly, so I just wanna see if it's true
I got the juice like GQ, but I wish it was Grey Goose
Let it mix with my prescriptions and I turn into Keith Moon
A T two, Terminator, Demigod, Jesus
Fort Minor: We Major, let's take it to phase two
The mission isn't finished yet, I been on the Internet
Hearin' fans talk and maybe we should consider it


Skin to bone and steel to rust
Skin to bone and steel to rust


I'm on some taxidermy rap shit, talk about some raw game
You're nothing but a trophy mounted on my door frame
I spit that propane, light you with a slow flame
And watch you burn until there's nothin' but a gold chain
Yeah you'll be some crispy critters
You'll wish you with us
You'll wish what we did, you did it
You can't, you kidding? I don't have a shoe you fit in
You're as soft as a motherfuckin' newborn kitten
I'm an animal, tearing flesh into bone
Randomly rippin' everything gone
Unless they forget what then let it be known
I'll bury every competitor, every predator
Anyone ever forget it, you'll regret it forever
Never been nothing short of a legend, you peasants will learn
I'll stay standin' in the front like I'm forgetting my turn
For these matchstick rappers, this is meeting adjourned
I ain't even gotta match them, I'm just letting them burn!"

"Oh my sun, it won't shine,
It won't light up the back of my mind.
And these fires, they won't burn,
But to blacken the memories I've earned.
And these walls, are so thin,
But they somehow keep holding me in.
'Cause I've pushed, and I know,
What's to come at the end of this road!

'Cause it goes through...

Well my sun, it won't shine,
It won't light up the back of my mind.
And these fires, they don't burn,
Except to blacken the memories I've earned.
And these walls, are so thin,
But they keep on holding me in.
'Cause I've pushed, and I know,
That there's nowhere left to go!

'Cause it goes through...

'Cause it goes through...

'Cause it goes through...

'Cause it goes through..."

You live what you've learned"
"I'm stuck in this bed you made
Alone with a sinking feeling
I saw through the words you said
To the secrets you've been keeping
It's written upon your face
All the lies how they cut so deeply
You can't get enough you take
And take and take and never say

No! You've gotta get it inside!
You push it back down! You push it back down!
No! You'll never get it inside!
Push it back down, black out, blood in your eye!

You say that it's not your fault
And swear that I am mistaken
You said it's not what it seems
No remorse for the trust you're breaking
You run but then back you fall
Suffocate in the mess you're making
You can't get enough you take
And take and take and take and take
Fuck it
Are you listening?

No! You've gotta get it inside!
You push it back down! You push it back down!
No! You'll never get it inside!
Push it back down! You push it back down!
No! You've gotta get it inside!
You push it back down! You push it back down!
No! You'll never get it inside!
Push it back down, black out, blood in your eye!


Floating down as colors fill the light
We look up from the ground in fields of paperwhite
And floating up you pass us in the night
A future gazing out a past to overwrite
So come down far below
We've been waiting to collect the things you know
Come down far below
We've been waiting to collect what you've let go


Come down, oh
Come down, oh
Come down
Come down, oh
Come down, oh"
"Weep not for roads untraveled
Weep not for paths left alone
'Cause beyond every bend
Is a long blinding end
It's the worst kind of pain
I've known

Give up your heart left broken
And let that mistake pass on
'Cause the love that you lost
Wasn't worth what it cost
And in time you'll be glad it's gone

Well, it's our life and it's our time, and it's our place and it's our choice
These are all our thoughts with our views, out of our minds with our voice
It's our oath to this generation, they call it fake, we call it fate
(You see) they don't like us or understand us, and they just hope we all fall away
But we won't stop, and we won't quit, and we won't settle for what they give
And we'll keep on standin', keep on fightin' no backin' down, that's how we're livin'
Our minds are made up and we're focused no more believin' what we've been told
'Cause our bags are packed, there's no turnin' back, we walk alone on these winding roads

Weep not for roads untraveled
Weep not for sights unseen
May your love never end
And if you need a friend
There's a seat here alongside me

May your love never end
And if you need a friend
There's a seat here alongside me"
"And it goes like ""Bang!""
And they're off and runnin'
Lookin' around like someone do somethin'
Scatter but it don't matter
I come gunnin'
So little time to squeeze all this fun in

Ah man, comin' at you now
Stupid enough to stand
We'll back you down
Like yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

What?

No, it can't be stopped
Break out ya little riot
Get it, call the cops
Call the SWAT team
Gimme all you got
The finger ready on the trigger
And we're callin' the shots

So, y'all really gonna brawl or not
My best bet's you probably gonna stall or stop
Got gall, my crew rocks, up into ya block
And when I sit back and put a hole in your chÃ¢teau, ha

We don't huff and puff
We'll turn your homeland and stuff
To a gust of dust
But I'm back act like enough's enough
Say a peep and I promise we'll fuck you up

Skip the rep for the sake of the family
I don't have to say a word
Y'all understand me
Stand up I'll put you back down flat
And we'll keep it likeâlikeâlike that!"
"Whatâs up?
Youâve reached Mike

Yo, Mike
This is Chali 2na, wâsup, man?
Iâm just trying to catch up with you, man,
so we can go ahead and get this song on the roll, with a pot-n-a-d
Haha, call me back, peace"
"This is where the pain comes from
This is how the payback sounds
This is why the fire goes up
This is why the walls come down

You ain't never been in these shoes
Never know a word that I'm saying
So the only thing to keep the blood flowing
Is to let you know I'm not playing

I'mma see your lies exposed
I'mma see the justice done
I'mma see the sun come back
I'mma see the kingdom come

Take it where it can't come back
Take it where the shadows been
Take it to the breaking point
Take it to the end

Saying that the end is near
God, you have no idea
Used to be afraid, but now
Only thing I fear is fear

This is where the line gets drawn
Something that you've always known
This is what you're hiding from
True fellows, never yours to own

Give me back the fire I had
Give me back the faith I lost
Give me back the trust you broke
Give me back the pride it cost

Take the venom out of my blood
Take the pain you put me in
Take it when I tell you so
Take it to the end"

He's got the Rap Patrol on the gat patrol
Foes that wanna make sure his casket's closed
Rap critics that say he's ""Money, Cash, Hoes""
He's from the hood stupid, what type of facts are those?
If you grew up with holes in your zapatoes
You'd celebrate the minute you was having dough
So fuck critics, you can kiss the whole asshole
If you don't like the lyrics, you can press fast forward
Got beef with radio if we don't play they show
They don't play our hits - we don't give a shit, so!
All these mags try and use our ass
So advertisers can give 'em more cash for ads, fuckers!
I don't know what you take us as
Or understand the intelligence that Jay-Z has
From, rags to riches, we ain't dumb
We got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one - hit me!

Now the year is ninety-four, in my trunk is raw
In the rear-view mirror is the motherfuckin' law
I got two choices y'all, pull over the car or (or?)
Bounce on the Devil, put the pedal to the floor (c'mon!)
And I ain't trying to see no highway chase with Jake
Plus I got a few dollars, I can fight the case
So, I pull over to the side of the road
I heard, ""Son, do you know why I'm stopping you for?""
'Cause I'm young and I'm black and my hat's real low
Or do I look like a mind reader sir? I don't know
Am I under arrest or should I guess some mo'?
(Well, you was doing fifty-five in the fifty-four
License and registration and step out of the car
Are you carrying a weapon on you? I know a lot of you are)
I ain't stepping out of shit, all my papers legit
(Well, do you mind if I look around the car a little bit?)
Well, my glove compartment is locked, so is the trunk in the back
And I know my rights, so you gon' need a warrant for that
(Aren't you sharp as a tack!
You some type of lawyer or something?
Somebody important or something?)
Ha, I ain't passed the bar, but I know a little bit
Enough that you won't illegally search my shit
(Well, we'll see how smart you are when the canines come)
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one - hit me!


99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you having girl problems I feel bad for you son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one - hit me!
99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you having girl problems I feel bad for you son

Now once upon a time, not too long ago
A nigga like myself had to strong-arm a ho
This is not a ho in the sense of having a pussy
But a pussy having no God damn sense, try and push me
I try to ignore him, talk to the Lord
Pray for him, but some fools just love to perform
You know the type, loud as a motorbike
But wouldn't bust a grape in a fruit fight
And only thing that's gon' happen is I'mma get to clapping and
He and his boys gon' be yapping to the Captain
And there I go, trapped in the Kit-Kat again
Back through the system with the riff-raff again
Fiends on the floor, scratching again
Paparazzis with they cameras, snapping them
D.A. try to give a nigga shaft again
Half a mill' for bail 'cause I'm African
All because this fool was harassing them
Trying to play the boy like he's saccharin
But ain't nothing sweet bout how I hold my gun
I got 99 problems bein' a bitch ain't one - hit me!


99 problems, but a bitch ain't one
If you having girl problems I feel bad for you son
I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one - hit me!

If you having girl problems I feel bad for you son

Stars are slipping down, glistening
And I'm trying not to think what I'm leaving now
No deceiving now
It's time you let me know
Let me know

When the lights go out and we open our eyes
Out there in the silence
I'll be gone
I'll be gone
Let the sun fade out and another one rise
Climbing through tomorrow
I'll be gone
I'll be gone

I'll be gone

Into winter now
Bitter-sweet
And 'cross that horizon this sun is setting down

Out there in the silence

And tell them I was alone
Oh, tell me I am the only one

"Crawling in my skin
These wounds they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

There's something inside me that pulls beneath the surface
Consuming confusing
This lack of self-control I fear is never ending
Controlling I can't seem


To find myself again
My walls are closing in
(Without a sense of confidence and I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take)
I've felt this way before
So insecure


Crawling in my skin
These wounds they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

Discomfort endlessly has pulled itself upon me
Distracting reacting
Against my will I stand beside my own reflection
It's haunting how I can't seem


To find myself again
My walls are closing in
(Without a sense of confidence and I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take)

"It's easier to run
Replacing this pain with something numb
It's so much easier to go
Than face all this pain here all alone

Something has been taken from deep inside of me
A secret I've kept locked away no one can ever see
Wounds so deep they never show, they never go away
Like moving pictures in my head, for years and years they've played


If I could change, I would take back the pain.
I would retrace every wrong move that I made.
I would...
If I could stand up and take the blame, I would.
If I could take all the shame to the grave, I would.

Bringing back these memories I wish I didn't have
Sometimes I think of letting go and never looking back
And never moving forward so there'd never be a past

All of the helplessness inside
Pretending I don't feel misplaced
Is so much simpler than change

The cold comes, racing through my skin
Searching for a way to get to you
Through the storm you...

Go, giving up your home
Go, leaving all you've known
You are not alone

With arms up stretched into the sky
With eyes like echoes in the night
Hiding from the hell that you've been through
Silent one, you...

Go, giving up your home
Go, leaving all you've known
You go, giving up your home
Go, leaving all you've known

I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you


Can't you see that you're smothering me
Holding too tightly, afraid to lose control?
'Cause everything that you thought I would be
Has fallen apart right in front of you

Every step that I take is another mistake to you

Just show that face for your witnesses
Just talk and, talk and, talk and lie

You're not really gonna stop and try
To make right of the wrong you caught me by

Forget about all that who and when
The hurt you knew that drew me in
The dirt you rubbed my bruises in
The guilt that I felt when the rules were bent
This is where the brand new begins
This is where the confusion is
I don't care if I lose or win
I just know that I don't want to pretend
Just talk and, talk and, laugh and grin
Here we go just like that again
Back to get stabbed in the back again

Love keeps us kind

Ya hardly see right next to the heart of me
Hurting me, the wounds soon scar
New cuts cover where the old ones are
And now I'm sick of this

I rather not even be than the man that's staring in the mirror through me

I feel I made my way
I feel it swell up inside, swell up inside
Swallowing me


Freedom can be frightening if you've never felt it
Once it's been dealt with you feel like you've been touched by something angelic
And then melted down into a pool of peace
Cease to be the animal you used to be
Remove the broken parts you know were wrong
And feel the calm when the problem's all gone
And then you start to see
Another piece of yourself that you can't let be
Memories of the last fight to free yourself
Take it to the depths of the bottom of the well
And now you know that you can choose to lose
The part in your heart where your insides bruised
You can live if you're willing to
Put a stop to just what's killing you

[4x]
Cut myself free willingly
Stop just what's killing me


I feel it every day
I feel I made my way
I feel it swell up inside, swell up inside
Swallowing me

[2x]
Alive in me
Inside of me
A part turns grey
And rots away silently

This part of me won't go away
Part of me won't go away

[2x]
Everywhere I look around
I see how everything ought to be
Every time I see myself
I see there's always something wrong with me

[2x]
I feel it every day
I feel I made my way
I feel it swell up inside, swell up inside
Swallowing me

[2x]
I feel it swell up inside, swell up inside
Swallowing me"
"(When this began)
I had nothing to say
And I'd get lost in the nothingness inside of me
(I was confused)
And I let it all out to find
That I'm not the only person with these things in mind
(Inside of me)
But all the vacancy the words revealed
Is the only real thing that I've got left to feel
(Nothing to lose)
Just stuck, hollow and alone
And the fault is my own, and the fault is my own


I wanna heal, I wanna feel what I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain I've felt so long
(Erase all the pain 'til it's gone)
I wanna heal, I wanna feel like I'm close to something real
I wanna find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong


And I've got nothing to say
I can't believe I didn't fall right down on my face
(I was confused)
Looking everywhere only to find
That it's not the way I had imagined it all in my mind
(So what am I?)
What do I have but negativity
'Cause I can't justify the way, everyone is looking at me
(Nothing to lose)
Nothing to gain, hollow and alone
And the fault is my own, and the fault is my own


I wanna heal, I wanna feel what I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain I've felt so long
(Erase all the pain 'til it's gone)
I wanna heal, I wanna feel like I'm close to something real
I wanna find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong

I will never know myself until I do this on my own
And I will never feel anything else, until my wounds are healed
I will never be anything 'til I break away from me
I will break away, I'll find myself today

I wanna heal, I wanna feel what I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain I've felt so long
(Erase all the pain 'til it's gone)
I wanna heal, I wanna feel like I'm close to something real
I wanna find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong

I wanna heal, I wanna feel like I'm somewhere I belong
I wanna heal, I wanna feel like I'm somewhere I belong
Somewhere I belong"
"Yeah
Uh


So what you waiting for?
Anticipating more
While you debate what it can take to instigate a war?
Yeah, I've been hated more than time I wasn't hated for
There's nothing they can fucking say they didn't say before
But you could never see it
Your battle's not mine
Wanna skate and play it safe but this is take a shot time
While you're waiting for a purpose I already got mine
While you tell me step to it like 1, 2, 3, 4


And if I do what you demand
(You say)
You'll let me understand
(You say)
You're gonna hold me to your word
And if I sell myself away
(You say)
I'll have no debt to pay
(You say)
I'm gonna get what I deserve
Whoa

Your word
Obeyed
My debt
Repaid
Our trust
Betrayed
All for nothing
All for nothing


Kick back there's no other way to say it
So let me break this fucker down for ya
I really don't know ya
You talk but let me show ya where to put your paranoia
You're joking, I don't have a half a sucker bone to throw ya
I'm disgusted, wonder what could've made ya tuck your tail below ya
And no I'm not your soldier I'm not taking any orders
I'm a five star general, infantry controller
Need a lesson? Let me show ya
Have you checking your composure
While I make you step to it like 1, 2, 3, 4


And if I do what you demand
(You say)
You'll let me understand
(You say)
You're gonna hold me to your word
And if I sell myself away
(You say)
I'll have no debt to pay

"No regret for the confidence betrayed
No more hiding in shadow
'Cause I won't wait for the debt to be repaid
Time has come for you


Victimized, victimized, never again victimized [2x]


They're acting like they want a riot, it's a riot I'll give them
As the siren climbs higher on this violent rhythm
For you snakes in the grass, supplying the venom
I ain't scared of your teeth, I admire what's in 'em
You've been waiting in the shadows there, thinking you're hidden
But the truth is you don't have the stomach to get 'em
Go on already, hit 'em! Yeah, you gotta be kiddin'
Wanna talk about a victim, I'mma put you there with 'em!


Victimized, victimized, never again victimized [2x]

"She had never really understood
She demanded her respect
Twenty years of falling under foot
Twenty reasons to regret

You would look for what you couldn't see
Scared to be what she became
She would tell you what you couldn't be
And why you had yourself to blame

Alone again
You try to disappear
And hold it in
Pretending not to hear

This voice without a sound
Voice that tears you down
You're trying not to fear
Saying this is in your head
But it whispers in your ear
Saying this is what you get

She was ready with your penalty
When eventually you'd fall
She was there inside your memory
Saying this was all your fault

Alone again
You try to disappear
And hold it in
Pretending not to hear

This voice without a sound
Voice that tears you down
You're trying not to fear
Saying this is in your head
But it whispers in your ear
Saying this is what you get

Alone again
It's all becoming clear
You hold it in
Pretending not to hear

This voice without a sound
Voice that tears you down
You're trying not to fear
Saying this is in your head
But it whispers in your ear
Saying this is what you get

This voice without a sound
Voice without a sound
This voice without a sound (without a sound)
Voice without a sound (without a sound)"
"It goes a one, two, three

I was born with the hunger of a lion, the strength of a sun
I don't need to sweat it when a competition come
Original style like an 808 drum
So I don't run the track, no, I make the track run
My mama taught me words, my daddy built rockets
I put 'em both together now, tell me what I got
It's a pretty smart weapon, I can shoot it, I can drop it
But learn to respect it 'cause you clearly can't stop it
Like that

It ain't over
'Cause the shark's on the left side, the snake's on the right
And anything you do, they wanna get a little bite
It really doesn't matter if you're wrong or if you're right
'Cause once they get their teeth in, nothing really fights
And as for me, I do it like I got nothing to lose
And you can run your mouth like you could try to fill my shoes
But steady, little soldier, I ain't standing next to you
I'll be laying on the ground before you're even in my view
Like that


Give me the strength of the rising sun
Give me the truth of the words unsung
And when the last bells ring
The poor men sing,
""Bring me to kingdom come.""


It's something for your people on the block to black out and rock to
Give you what you need like poppa, who shot you
""Separate the weak from the obsolete""
You're the meek, I creep hard on impostors
And switch styles on a dime, quick-witted y'all
Quit tripping, I don't have time for your crying
I grind tough, sucker, make your mind up
Are you in the firing squad or are you in the line-up?
Bang, bang, little monkey man playing
With the big guns only get you slain
I ain't playing, I'm just saying
You ain't got a sliver of a chance
I get iller, I deliver while you quiver in your pants
So shake, shake down, money, here's the breakdown
You can play the bank, I'mma play the bank take-down
And no mistakes now, coming to get you
I'm just a Banksy, you're a Brainwash, get the picture?
It's like that


We swim against the rising waves
And crash against the shore
The body bends until it breaks
The early morning sings no more

So rest your head
It's time to sleep
And dream of what's in store
The body bends until it breaks
And sings again no more
'Cause time has torn the flesh away
The early morning sings no more"
"I've seen the blood
I've seen the broken
The lost and the sights unseen
I want a flood
I want an ocean
To wash my confusion clean

I can't resolve this empty story
I can't repair the damage done


We are the fortunate ones
Who've never faced oppression's gun
We are the fortunate ones
Imitations of rebellion


We acted out
We wear the colors
Confined by the things we own
We're not without
We're like each other
Pretending we're here alone

And far away, they burn their buildings
Right in the face of the damage done


We are the fortunate ones
Who've never faced oppression's gun
We are the fortunate ones
Imitations of rebellion
Rebellion, rebellion, rebellion


Rebellion, rebellion
We lost before the start
Rebellion, rebellion
One by one we fall apart
We fall apart
We fall apart
We fall apart


We are the fortunate ones
Who've never faced oppression's gun
We are the fortunate ones
Imitations of
Imitations of...

We are the fortunate ones
Who've never faced oppression's gun

Imitations of rebellion

"This is war with no weapons,
Marching with no stepping,
Murder with no killing,
Illing every direction.
First, no sequel,
Do the math, no equal
John with no Yoko
More power, less people
And no I'm not afraid of that
Print it in your paperback
Every rap is made in fact
To act as a delayed attack
Every phrase a razor blade
That's saved until they play it back
To slay and leave 'em laying on the pavement
Bang
Fade to black


In the wastelands of today,
When there's nothing left to lose,
And there's nothing more to take,
But you force yourself to choose,
In the wastelands of today,
When tomorrow disappears
When the future slips away,
And your hope turns into fear,
In the wastelands of today


Roll credits, to get it,
The show's done,
They're talking for just talking,
But meaning they got none,
None of 'em come proper,
They talk like a shotgun,
But how many got bred with integrity,
Not one
So no, I'm not afraid to see these suckers hold a blade to me,
Ain't a way to shake the ground I built before you came to be,
Take it how you take it, I'm the opposite of vacancy,
And this is not negotiation, y'all can hate and wait and see...

"In this desert
In darkness
Lying with the gun across his chest
Pretending
He's heartless
As the fire flashes in the sky
He was fragile
And frozen
When the bullet took away his friend
And now he's somehow
More broken

He's pulling his weapon to his side
Loading it full of his goodbyes
Holding an enemy across the line
He's pulling his weapon to his side
Loading it full of his goodbyes
Holding an enemy across the line

Sweating
And shaking
Lying with her hands across her chest
She wakes with
Her cravings
As the fire flashes in her eye
She was fragile
And frozen
When the needle took away her friend
But now she's somehow
More broken

She's pulling her weapon to her side
Loading it full of her goodbyes
Holding an enemy across the line
She's pulling her weapon to her side
Loading it full of her goodbyes
Holding an enemy across the line

With every battle he's choosing
With every fight he's losing
His enemy's not far behind
With every promise she's broken
With every lie she's spoken
Her enemy's not far behind

It's your time
It's your time
It's your time
It's your time!

He's pulling his weapon to his side
Loading it full of his goodbyes
Holding an enemy across the line

She's pulling her weapon to her side
Loading it full of her goodbyes
Holding an enemy across the line

With every battle he's choosing
With every fight he's losing
His enemy's not far behind
With every promise she's broken
With every lie she's spoken
Her enemy's not far behind"
"I remembered black skies
The lightning all around me
I remembered each flash
As time began to blur
Like a startling sign
That fate had finally found me
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve

So give me reason
To prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross
The distance in your eyes
Give me reason
To fill this hole
Connect this space between
Let it be enough to reach the truth that lies
Across this new divide

There was nothing in sight
But memories left abandoned
There was nowhere to hide
The ashes fell like snow
And the ground caved in
Between where we were standing
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve

So give me reason
To prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross
The distance in your eyes
Across this new divide

In every loss in every lie
In every truth that you'd deny
And each regret and each goodbye
Was a mistake too great to hide
And your voice was all I heard
That I get what I deserve

So give me reason
To prove me wrong
To wash this memory clean
Let the floods cross
The distance in your eyes
Give me reason
To fill this hole
Connect this space between

"One, two, one, two, thank you!

There's no peace
Only war
Victory decides who's wrong or right
It will not cease
Only grow
You better be prepared to fight!

And it will not apologize
For laying down your life

War

There's no pain
It will spare
Fear has become your only right
And once you're lost
In your despair
Forever black, eternal night

And it will not apologize
For laying down your life

War
Destroyer
War
Destroyer

It needs no side to justify
Laying down your life

War
Destroyer

Ash to ashes, dust to dust
Let tomorrow have its way
With the promises we made
Skin to bone, steel to rust.

Ash to ashes, dust to dust
Your deception, my disgust
When your name is finally drawn,
I'll be happy that you're gone
Ash to ashes, dust to dust.

(ah) ash to ashes, dust to dust
(ah) skin to bone and steel to rust

Right to left, left to right
Night to day and day to night
As the starlight fades to gray,
I'll be marching far away

Let tomorrow have its way?

"In the dark days
I'll part ways
With the blame.
Trying to maintain
But it's still all the same
It's all a game.
Hear my name in the rain
And the pain,
I wear my face with a tear stain

You feign fondness, honestly it's time
To give you a piece of my mind
And show you that you're blind.
And in the design
Of the world I call mine
Know that you can't stand on both sides
Of the line.

Everything is my fault
(It's all the same, just pass me the blame)
The problems have two faces
Everything is my fault
(It's all the same, just pass me the blame)
The problems have two faces

Pass all the blame over to me
It will come eventually
Take the time out to examine
All these questions honestly

With my eyes shut
I'm seeing the truth in your words
The absurd
Slurred into beauty to be heard
You swim through deceit
The lies that you tell
The stories you sell
Knowing you well
I keep distance
And every instance
You keep your thoughts concealed
What I feel
Just another spoke in the wheel
All or nothing
Thrown down and trampled by your heel
And eaten away
By my own version of the real

Everything is my fault
(It's all the same, just pass me the blame)
The problems have two faces
Everything is my fault
(It's all the same, just pass me the blame)
The problems have two faces

Pass all the blame over to me
It will come eventually
Take the time out to examine
All these questions honestly

You're always to blame?

Nothing, thrown down
(It's all the same, just pass me the blame)
Trampled by your heel
(Play the game and wear the tear stain)
Eaten by my own
(Pass the pain, 'cause you'll feel it if you don't)
Version of the real
(Stop counting 'til you've got your own)

"There's a fragile game we play
With the ghosts of yesterday
If we can't let go, we'll never say goodbye

No trace of what remains
No stones to mark the graves
Only memories we thought we could deny

There was so much more to lose
Than the pain I put you through
In my carelessness I left you in the dark

And the blood may wash away
But the scars will never fade
At least I know somehow I made a mark

In the dark
In the light
Nothing left
Nothing right

In the dark
In the light
Nothing left
Nothing right

In the dark
In the light
Nothing left
Nothing right

"Tearing me apart with words you wouldn't say,
And suddenly tomorrow's moment washed away.
'Cause I don't have a reason, and you don't have the time,
But we both keep on waiting for something we won't find.

The light on the horizon was brighter yesterday,
With shadows floating over, the scars began to fade.
We said it was forever but then it slipped away,
Standing at the end of the final masquerade.

The final masquerade!

All I ever wanted, the secrets that you keep,
All you've ever wanted, the truth I couldn't speak.
'Cause I can't see forgiveness, and you can't see the crime,
And we both keep on waiting for what we left behind.

The light on the horizon was brighter yesterday,
With shadows floating over, the scars began to fade.
We said it was forever but then it slipped away,
Standing at the end of the final masquerade.

"Folks, we have a very special guest for you tonight.
I'd like to introduce...
Mr. Hahn!

Let's hear it for the great Mr. Hahn!

And now for a lesson in rhythm management.
Let's begin...

Alright now. Wasn't that fun?
Let's try something else."
"In the center of the silence
Violent thoughts are thrown through
The thick smoke and flickering lights that brighten the room
All the things that you wanted to say get lost and thrown away
You can fade and hesitate to speak your mind
Can't turn back when you cross the line
Sometimes there's someone you know who just doesn't care
Has to see you go to know you were there

This is the sun behind the rain
Even if sometimes I feel I can't stand another minute
May begun to run an endless race
But I never look back when I begin it
Feel that this is the sun behind the rain
Even if sometimes I feel I can't stand another minute
May begun to run an endless race
But I never look back when I begin it

I know all of this will soon be gone
You don't really have to prove them wrong

Sometimes you got no control of where you go
Taken down a road you don't know
And you feel so lost that you wanna hide your face
You don't recognize the place your in
Sometimes the sun doesn't shine your way
Sometimes the night doesn't turn to day
But sometimes the light's so bright it burns through the night
And keeps the darkness at bay (far away)

This is the sun behind the rain
Even if sometimes I feel I can't stand another minute
May begun to run an endless race
But I never look back when I begin it
Feel that this is the sun behind the rain
Even if sometimes I feel I can't stand another minute
May begun to run an endless race
But I never look back when I begin it

I know all of this will soon be gone
You don't really have to prove them wrong
I know soon enough you'll make them see
You'll be far away from them with me

Follow the link in the chain without a name
Still alight the darkened days' remains
Taken away from the place you've been trapped
Break all you know to bring it all back

This is the sun behind the rain
Even if sometimes I feel I can't stand another minute
May begun to run an endless race
But I never look back when I begin it
Feel that this is the sun behind the rain
Even if sometimes I feel I can't stand another minute
May begun to run an endless race
But I never look back when I begin it

I know all of this will soon be gone
You don't really have to prove them wrong
I know soon enough you'll make them see
You'll be far away from them alone with me"
"Tell us all again
What you think we should be
What the answers are
What it is we can't see
Tell us all again
How to do what you say
How to fall in line
How there's no other way

You're guilty all the same
Too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger
But there's no one else to blame

You're guilty all the same
Too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger
But there's no one else to blame

You're guilty all the same

Show us all again
That our hands are unclean
That we're unprepared
That you have what we need
Show us all again
'Cause we cannot be saved
'Cause the end is near

Yeah, you already know what it is
Can y'all explain what kind of land is this when a man has plans of being rich
But the bosses plans is wealthy?
Dirty money scheme, a clean split is nonsense
It's insane
Even corporate hands is filthy
They talk team and take the paper route
All they think about is bank accounts, assets and realty
At anybody's expense,
No shame with a clear conscience
No regrets and guilt free,
They claim that ain't the way that they built me
The smoke screen before the flame
Knowing as soon as the dough or the deal peak
They say it's time for things to change
Re-arrange like good product re-built cheap
Anything if it's more to gain
Drained, manipulated like artists, it's real deep
Until no more remains, but I'm still me
Like authentic hip-hop and rock,
'Til pop and radio and record companies killed me
Try to force me to stray and obey
And got the gall to say how real can real be
You feel me, we'll see that green could be to blame
Or greedy for the fame,
TV or a name
The media, the game,
To me you're all the same
You're guilty

You're guilty all the same
Too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger
But there's no one else to blame

You're guilty all the same
Too sick to be ashamed
You want to point your finger
But there's no one else to blame
There's no one else to blame

Guilty all the same
Guilty all the same
Guilty all the same"
"Where should I start
Disjointed heart
I've got no commitment
To my own flesh and blood
Left all alone
Far from my home
No one to hear me, to heal my ill heart, I

Keep it locked up inside

Cannot express
To the point I've regressed
If anger's a gift, then I guess I've been blessed, I

Keep it locked up inside
Keep my distance from your lies

It's too late to love me now
You have never shown me
It's too late to love me now
You don't even know me

Breaking a part of my heart to find release
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace
Breaking a part of my heart to find release
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace

Breaking a part of my heart to find release (Break)
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace (Me)
Breaking a part of my heart to find release (Too)
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace

Keep it locked up inside
Keep my distance from your lies

Breaking a part of my heart to find release (Break)
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace (Me)
Breaking a part of my heart to find release (Too)
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace
Breaking a part of my heart to find release
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace
Breaking a part of my heart to find release
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace

Keep my distance
Keep my distance
Keep my distance
Keep my distance

Spit drips from the jaw of the witless witness
Cryptic colloquialisms shift your mid rift
Dog-paddle through a bog of shadows and smog
With my thought catalog, analog, rap battle log
Keep my distance, and fear resistance, hurt by persistence
The twisted web of tangled lies strangles my hope to waste and numbs the taste
And I'm forced to face these hate crimes against the state of being, feeling the weightlessness, press me to the ceiling, reeling around rooms, riding a bubble of sound
Tuned to the frequency making your chest shake with every boom, involuntary muscle contraction
Ignoring your neck's breaking, musical gas fume euphoria
The sound pounds to make the dead flush
To hand you a head rush with read rhymes and said stuff"
"Come on

I woke up in a dream today
To the cold and the static
And I put my cold feet on the floor
Forgot all about yesterday
Remembering Iâm pretending to be where Iâm not anymore
A little taste of hipocrisy
And Iâm left in the wake of the mistake
Slow to react
Even though youâre so close to me
Youâre still so distant
And I canât bring you back

Itâs true
The way I feel
Was promised by your face
The sound of your voice
Painted on my memories
Even if youâre not with me

Iâm with you
You, now I see
Keeping everything inside
With You
You, now I see
Even when I close my eyes
With you
You, now I see
Keeping everything inside
With You
You, now I see
Even when I close my eyes

I hit you and you hit me back
We fall to the floor
The rest of the day stands still
Fine line between this and that
But when things go wrong
I pretend that the past isnât real
Iâm trapped in this memory
And Iâm left in the wake of the mistake
Slow to react
Even though youâre so close to me
Youâre still so distant
And I canât bring you back

Itâs true
The way I feel
Was promised by your face
The sound of your voice
Painted on my memories
Even if youâre not with me

Iâm with you
You, now I see
Keeping everything inside
With You
You, now I see
Even when I close my eyes
With you
You, now I see
Keeping everything inside
With You
You, now I see
Even when I close my eyes

No, I wonât let you control my fate
While Iâm holding the weight of the world on my conscience
No, I wonât just sit here and wait
While you weighing options
Youâre making a fool of me
No, you didnât dare try to say that you donât care
And solemnly swear not to follow me there
No, it ainât like me to beg on my knees
Oh, please, oh, baby, please
Thatâs not how Iâm doing things
No, Iâm not upset
No, Iâm not angry
I know love is love, 
Love and sometimes it pains me
With or without you
Iâll always be with you
Youâll never forget me
Iâm keeping you with me
No, I wonât let you take me to the end of my rope
While you burn it and torture my soul
No, Iâm not your puppet
And, no, no, no, I wonât let you go

No, no matter how far weâve come
I canât wait to see tomorrow
No matter how far weâve come, I
I canât wait to see tomorrow

With you
You, now I see
Keeping everything inside
With You
You, now I see
Even when I close my eyes
With you
You, now I see
Keeping everything inside
With You
You, now I see
Even when I close my eyes"
"This is my December
This is my time of the year
This is my December
This is all so clear
This is my December
This is my snow-covered home
This is my December
This is me alone


And I just wish that I didn't feel like there was something I missed
And I take back all the things I said to make you feel like that
And I just wish that I didn't feel like there was something I missed
And I take back all the things that I said to you


And I'd give it all away
Just to have somewhere
To go to
Give it all away
To have someone
To come home to

This is my December
These are my snow-covered trees
This is me pretending
This is all I need


And I just wish that I didn't feel like there was something I missed
And I take back all the things I said to make you feel like that
And I just wish that I didn't feel like there was something I missed
And I take back all the things that I said to you


And I'd give it all away
Just to have
Somewhere to go to
Give it all away
To have someone
To come home to

This is my December
This is my time of the year
This is my December
This is all so clear

Give it all away
Just to have somewhere
To go to
Give it all away
To have someone
To come home to

Give it all away
Just to have somewhere
To go to
Give it all away
To have someone
To come home to"
"I got a long way to go
And a long memory
I been searching for an answer
Always just out of reach
Blood on the floor
Sirens repeat
I been searching for the courage
To face my enemies

When they turn down the lights

I hear my battle symphony
All the world in front of me
If my armor breaks
I'll fuse it back together
Battle symphony
Please just don't give up on me
And my eyes are wide awake

For my battle symphony
For my battle symphony

They say that I don't belong
Say that I should retreat
That I'm marching to the rhythm
Of a lonesome defeat
But the sound of your voice
Puts the pain in reverse
No surrender, no illusions
And for better or worse

When they turn down the lights

I hear my battle symphony
All the world in front of me
If my armor breaks
I'll fuse it back together
Battle symphony
Please just don't give up on me
And my eyes are wide awake

If I fall, get knocked down
Pick myself up off the ground
If I fall, get knocked down
Pick myself up off the ground

When they turn down the lights

I hear my battle symphony
All the world in front of me
If my armor breaks
I'll fuse it back together
Battle symphony
Please just don't give up on me
And my eyes are wide awake

For my battle symphony
For my battle symphony"
"My insides all turned to ash, so slow
And blew away as I collapsed, so cold
A black wind took them away, from sight
And held the darkness over day, that night

And the clouds above move closer
Looking so dissatisfied
But the heartless wind kept blowing, blowing
I used to be my own protection, but not now
Cause my path has lost direction, somehow
A black wind took you away, from sight
And held the darkness over day, that night

And the clouds above move closer
Looking so dissatisfied
And the ground below grew colder
As they put you down inside
But the heartless wind kept blowing, blowing

So now you're gone, and I was wrong
I never knew what it was like, to be alone

On a Valentine's Day, on a Valentine's Day
On a Valentine's Day, on a Valentine's Day
On a Valentine's Day, on a Valentine's Day
(I used to be my own protection, but not now)
On a Valentine's Day, on a Valentine's Day
(Cause my mind has lost direction, somehow)
On a Valentine's Day, on a Valentine's Day
(I used to be my own protection, but not now)
On a Valentine's Day, on a Valentine's Day
(Cause my mind has lost direction, somehow)"
"In this farewell
There's no blood
There's no alibi
'Cause I've drawn regret
From the truth
Of a thousand lies

So let mercy come
And wash away
What I've done

I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done

Put to rest
What you thought of me
While I clean this slate
With the hands of uncertainty

So let mercy come
And wash away
What I've done

I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done

For what I've done

I start again
And whatever pain may come
Today this ends
I'm forgiving what I've done!

I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done

What I've done
Forgiving what I've done"
"You say you're not gonna fight 'cause no one will fight for you
'Cause you think there's not enough love and no one to give it to
And you say that faith is a lie and fear is your only truth
And you're sure that everyone else is feeling the way you do

You say you've hurt for so long that pain isn't something new
But don't think the things that they've done predict what you're going to do
The truth is if trust is a gift it's something we all can lose
So hold on, it's not where it goes, it's where it can lead you to

Hold on, it's not where it goes, it's where it can lead you to
Hold on, it's not where it goes, it's where it can lead you to
Hold on, it's not where it goes, it's where it can lead you to
Hold on, it's not where it goes, it's where it can lead you to"
"Weep not for roads untraveled
Weep not for paths left alone
'Cause beyond every bend
Is a long blinding end
It's the worst kind of pain
I've known

Give up your heart left broken
And let that mistake pass on
'Cause the love that you lost
Wasn't worth what it cost
And in time you'll be glad it's gone


Whoa-oo-oh-oh
Whoa-oo-oh
Whoa-oo-oh-oh
Whoa-oo-oh

Weep not for roads untraveled
Weep not for sights unseen
May your love never end
And if you need a friend
There's a seat here alongside me

Whoa-oo-oh-oh
Whoa-oo-oh
Whoa-oo-oh-oh
Whoa-oo-oh"

"Down on the floor
Back behind the door
I try to catch my breath again
I can't ignore
What's back behind the door
Wondering what's next again

I can say that you're the one
That battles always choose
But sometimes I realize
That I'm the one confused

I don't know what we're fighting for
Or why we have to scream
I don't know why I instigate
And say what I don't mean
I don't know how we got this way
I know it's not alright
So I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit, tonight

Memories consume, pacing in the room
Cleaning broken glass again
Suddenly soon you're leaving from the room
It's happening so fast again

I can say that you're the one
That battles always choose
But sometimes I realize
That I'm the one confused

I don't know what we're fighting for
Or why we have to scream
I don't know why I instigate
And say what I don't mean
I don't know how we got this way
I know it's not alright
So I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit, tonight

Crashing into walls
It never was your fault
So here we are again
And this is how it ends

I don't know what we're fighting for
Or why we have to scream
I don't know why I instigate
And say what I don't mean
I don't know how we got this way
I know it's not alright
So I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit, tonight"
"Sometimes I need to remember just to breathe
Sometimes I need you to stay away from me
Sometimes I'm in disbelief I didn't know
Somehow I need you to go

Don't stay
Forget our memories
Forget our possibilities
What you were changing me into
(Just give me myself back and)
Don't stay
Forget our memories
Forget our possibilities
Take all your faithlessness with you
Just give me myself back and
Don't stay

Sometimes I feel like I trusted you too well
Sometimes I just feel like screaming at myself
Sometimes I'm in disbelief I didn't know
Somehow I need to be alone

Don't stay
Forget our memories
Forget our possibilities
What you were changing me into
(Just give me myself back and)
Don't stay
Forget our memories
Forget our possibilities
Take all your faithlessness with you
Just give me myself back and
Don't stay

I don't need you anymore, I don't want to be ignored
I don't need one more day of you wasting me away
I don't need you anymore, I don't want to be ignored
I don't need one more day of you wasting me away

With no apologies

Don't stay
Forget our memories
Forget our possibilities
What you were changing me into

Don't stay
Forget our memories
Forget our possibilities
Take all your faithlessness with you
Just give me myself back and

"I've lied to you
The same way that I always do
This is the last smile
That I'll fake for the sake of being with you


(Everything falls apart
Even the people who never frown
Eventually break down)
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
(Everything has to end
You'll soon find we're out of time left
To watch it all unwind)
The sacrifice is never knowing


Why I never walked away
Why I played myself this way
Now I see your testing me pushes me away
Why I never walked away
Why I played myself this way
Now I see your testing me pushes me away

I've tried like you
To do everything you wanted to
This is the last time
I'll take the blame for the sake of being with you

Eventually break down)
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie

"Nah you don't know me
Lightning above and a fire below me
You cannot catch me, cannot hold me
You cannot stop, much less control me

When it rains it pours
When the floodgates open, brace your shores
That pressure don't care when it breaks your door
Say it's all you can take, better take some more

When I was young they told me, they said
Make your bed you lie in that bed
A king can't hold my rings so instead
It comes that day, it's off with his head

The night gets darkest right before dawn
What don't kill you makes you more strong
You'll have my mercy then when you're gone

'Cause I know what it's like to test fate
Had my shoulders pressed with that weight
Stood up strong in spite of that hate

The night gets darkest right before dawn
What don't kill you makes you more strong
You'll have my mercy then when you're gone

The nights go on
Waiting for a light that never comes
I chase the sun
Waiting for a light that never comes
Oh oh oh
Waiting for a light that never comes

Nah you don't know me
Lightning above and a fire below me
You cannot catch me, cannot hold me
You cannot stop, much less control me

When it rains it pours
When the floodgates open, brace your shores
That pressure don't care when it breaks your door
Say it's all you can take, better take some more

The nights go on
Waiting for a light that never comes
I chase the sun
Waiting for a light that never comes
Oh oh oh
Waiting for a light that never comes

The nights go on
Waiting for a light that never comes (take some more)
I chase the sun
Waiting for a light that never comes"
"We swim against the rising waves and crash against the shore
The body bends until it breaks, the early morning sings no more

We swim against the rising waves and crash against the shore
The body bends until it breaks, then sings again no more
The winds have torn the flesh away, the early morning sings no more

We swim against the rising waves and crash against the shore
The body bends until it breaks, then sings again no more
The winds have torn the flesh away, the early morning sings no more

'Cause time has torn the flesh away, the early morning sings no more"
"Watching the wings cut through the clouds
Watching the raindrops blinking red and white
Thinking of you back on the ground
There with a fire burning in your eyes
I only halfway apologized


And I'll be sorry for now
That I couldn't be around
Sometimes things refuse
To go the way we planned
Oh I'll be sorry for now
That I couldn't be around
There will be a day
That you will understand
You will understand


After a while you may forget
But just in case the memories cross your mind
You couldn't know this when I left
Under the fire of your angry eyes
I never wanted to say goodbye


So I'll be sorry for now
That I couldn't be around
Sometimes things refuse
To go the way we planned
Oh I'll be sorry for now
That I couldn't be around
There will be a day
That you will understand
You will understand


Yeah, stop telling 'em to pump the bass up
Tried to call home but nobody could wait up
Switch your time zones can't pick the pace up
I just passed out by the time you wake up
Best things come to those who wait
And it's bound to get rough on any road you take
But don't you ever have a doubt and make no mistake
I can't wait to come back when I'm going away


So I'll be sorry for now
That I couldn't be around
There are things we have to do that we can't stand
Oh I'll be sorry for now
That I couldn't be around
There will be a day that you will understand
Oh I'll be sorry for now
That I couldn't be around
There are things we have to do that we can't stand
(Things we have to do that we can't stand)
Oh I'll be sorry for now
That I couldn't be around
There will be a day that you will understand
You will understand [3x]"
"I have a dream of a scene between the green hills
Clouds pull away and the sunlight's revealed
People don't talk about keeping it real
It's understood that they actually will
And intoxicated and stimulated MCs
Staring in the trees, paranoid, are gone in the breeze
Watch them flee, hip-hop heads
Take a walk with me and what you'll see
Is a land where the sand's made of crushed up wax
And the sky beyond you is krylon blue
And everybody speaks in a dialect of rhyme
And MCs have left materialism behind them
Meanwhile I just grip my mic
And hope me and my team make it through alright
Because say what you will, and say what you might
But don't ignore who it's for at the end of the night

Because this is dedicated to the kids
Dedicated to wherever music lives
Dedicated to those tired of the same old same
And dedicated to the people advancin' the game
What's real is the kids who know that something's wrong
What's real is the kids who think they don't belong
What's real is the kids who have nowhere to run
Who are hiding in the shadows waiting for the sun

I've seen a lot of shit, I've talked to a bum
Out on sunset strip, he asked me, ""How would you feel
If everybody acted like you didn't exist?
You'd lose your grip, probably eventually flip.""
So let it be known, the only reason that we do this
Is so you can pick it up and just bang your head to it
While MCs fight to see who can be the commonest
We float overhead like a space odyssey monolith
Over seeing the game, over being part of the same old thing
It's all gonna change in a hurricane of darkness and pain
And acidic rain and promises that you won't do it again
Meanwhile I just grip my mic
And hope me and my team make it through alright
Because say what you will, and say what you might
But don't ignore who it's for at the end of the night

Because this is dedicated to the kids
Dedicated to wherever music lives
Dedicated to those tired of the same old same
And dedicated to the people advancin' the game
What's real is the kids who know that something's wrong
What's real is the kids who think they don't belong
What's real is the kids who have nowhere to run
Who are hiding in the shadows waiting for the sun

Pulling me close, the shadow is warm inside
This is where I feel at home, this is my place to hide
Pulling me close, the shadow is warm inside
This is where I feel at home, this is my place to hide

Because this is dedicated to the kids
Dedicated to wherever music lives
Dedicated to those tired of the same old same
And dedicated to the people advancin' the game
What's real is the kids who know that something's wrong
What's real is the kids who think they don't belong
What's real is the kids who have nowhere to run
Who are hiding in the shadows waiting for the sun

This is dedicated to the kids
Dedicated to wherever music lives
Dedicated to those tired of the same old same
And dedicated to the people advancin' the game
What's real, everybody who doesn't feel safe
What's real, everybody who knows they're out of place
What's real, anybody with nowhere to run
Who hides in the shadows waiting for the sun"
"Ladies and gents, sorry to keep ya'll waiting
This goes out to everybody still hating
For those that fake, ya'll can keep on fakin'
I'm cooking a plate for you to stick your whole face in

Tastes good, don't it, cousin?
Just so you know it's nothin'
I get you buggin' like some codeine in some Robitussin
It's just the way that I approach each time
I slap the track and turn around and choke each rhyme

Broadcast to the nation like NBC
With pages of 16s like an MPC
Deliver an ass-whipping via MP3
Giving you people more reality than MTV

Do it PPV
Snap necks with the pressure
Make a mess
Then carry you out on a stretcher
You could sue, butâoohâthe law won't protect ya
Even the court room sketcher could not sketch ya

You're not following me
Got your number like Caller ID
Try it, you can holler at me
I promise you pain
I will chop your body in threes
And you'll be sitting there stuttering, ""Proba-bably.""

Follow me
I got styles
You can copy one
Back of your mind
I know you wanna stop me, son
But here's news for you, fucker: that can not be done
You can think that I am finished I have not begun

I'm grinding
Putting these kids to bed
You think you're hard-boiled
Fucker, you're an Easter egg
You got a pastel shell and a soft inside
Squash your pride
You think I fucking lost my mind
I'm not playing

I might as well be making a bomb
I lay you down to foundation when I'm taking you on
Bet the farm on the rhyme for the sake of my mom
She's like,
""Mike, show these pigs what kind of bacon you're on.""

It's funny but don't laugh
Money with no cash
The villain of vocab
I'm killing this notepad
The realest I wrote man
You don't even know half
I'm banking a full tank
You're running on low gas

Take that
I'm cutting off your fun
You're nothing but a butter knife stopping a gun
We can dance but your chances are slim to none
And you can think that I am finished I have not begun

Got a razor-blade tongue and I get this done
No running just dumping on your clique for fun
Machine Shop got it locked like the game's a joke
Say something funny get the whole gang provoked

Better buckle down, fucker
Go get your own
We been working ten years just to get this known
The people on the block starting to get numb
They expect that it's fresh when the new shit come

Here it goes, let 'em know they can fix the frown
Railroad rap hot tracks running you down
And they ask and repeat how I do this now
Like I'm really gonna tell 'em how I get this sound

We just do what we do, give you that fix
We come in the back like we run this bitch
Turn the lights down low
And we start the show
When I give it to ya
Give it right back and it goes

Take that
Take that
Cutting off your fun
You're nothing but a butter knife stopping a gun
We can dance but your chances are slim to none
You can think that I am finished I have not begun

Follow me
I got styles
You can copy one
Back of your mind
I know you wanna stop me son
But here's news for you fucker: that can not be done
You can think that I am finished I have not begun"
"I'mma be that nail in your coffin
Saying that I softened
I was ducking down to reload
So you can save your petty explanations
I don't have the patience
Before you even say it I know
You let your pride or your ego
Talk slick to me, no
That is not the way I get down
And look at how you lose your composure
Now let me show ya
Exactly how the breaking point sounds

I want to see you choke on your lies
Swallow up your greed
Suffer all alone in your misery
Choke on your lies
Swallow up your greed
Suffer all alone in your misery

What is it you want me to tell you
I am not the failure
I would rather live and let be
But you came with the right kind of threat to
Push me to let you
Know you can't intimidate me
You disrespect me so clearly
Now you better hear me
That is not the way it goes down
You did it to yourself and it's over
Now let me show you
Exactly how the breaking point sounds

I want to see you choke on your lies
Swallow up your greed
Suffer all alone in your misery
Choke on your lies
Swallow up your greed
Suffer all alone in your misery
I want to see you choke on your lies
Swallow up your greed
Suffer all alone in your misery
Choke on your lies
Swallow up your greed
Suffer all alone in your misery

You did it to yourself [8x]

I want to see you choke on your lies
Swallow up your greed
Suffer all alone in your misery
Choke on your lies
Swallow up your greed
Suffer all alone in your misery"
"Standing alone with no direction
How did I fall so far behind?
Why am I searching for perfection
Knowing it's something I won't find?

In my fear and flaws
I let myself down again
All because

I run
'Til the silence splits me open
I run
'Til it puts me underground
'Til I have no breath
And no roads left but one

When did I lose my sense of purpose?
Can I regain what's lost inside?
Why do I feel like I deserve this?
Why does my pain look like my pride?

In my fear and flaws
I let myself down again
All because
I let myself down
In my fear and flaws

I run
'Til the silence splits me open
I run
'Til it puts me underground
'Til I have no breath
And no roads left but one
No roads left but one

In my fear and flaws
I let myself down again
All because

I run
And the silence splits me open
I run
And it puts me underground
But there's no regret
And no roads left to run"

Wasn't that fun?
Let's try something else

Forty-five caliber killer, but out of the Phila-
-dela thriller show you brothers how you not a guerilla
Smooth talkin', fully automatic weapon concealer
Taste thriller, great fillers, hit 'em with the bounce filler
Filthy stinkin', standin' on solid ground and still be sinkin'
Submergin' in the Parks and still be Linkin
Pluck beef when it starts, but fuck your thinkin'
It's not a mirage
I rip the motherfuckin' track up from out the garage
Where I'm hip to the duck, but it's hard to dodge
In the back of that spine where my darts is lodged
Thought flippin' straight up, rippin' apart your squad
X-Ecutioner style, that cuts and blends
Like a syringe, we bangin' you in each of your limbs
See me comin' through your party hard, without no bodyguard
Smokin' somethin', stompin' on each of your Timbs
I'm the B to the L, the A, the C-King (uh huh..)
And when it comes to plannin' the Thought, keep thinkin' that

Shut up

"When you were standing in the wake of devastation
When you were waiting on the edge of the unknown
And with the cataclysm raining down
Insides crying, ""Save me now!""
You were there, impossibly alone

Do you feel cold and lost in desperation?
You build up hope, but failure's all you've known
Remember all the sadness and frustration
And let it go. Let it go

And in a burst of light that blinded every angel
As if the sky had blown the heavens into stars
You felt the gravity of tempered grace
Falling into empty space
No one there to catch you in their arms

Do you feel cold and lost in desperation?
You build up hope, but failure's all you've known
Remember all the sadness and frustration
And let it go. Let it go

Do you feel cold and lost in desperation?
You build up hope, but failure's all you've known
Remember all the sadness and frustration
And let it go. Let it go

Let it go

Do you feel cold and lost in desperation?
You build up hope, but failure's all you've known
Remember all the sadness and frustration
And let it go. Let it go"
"And I'm taking my time
I'm shaping and shaking the rhyme
Like I'm staking my claim
Like I'm making a bomb
I'm making it simple and plain
And I'm sick of the game
Sick of the simple and same
I got that reality rap back to the basics
Give me that beat
It is what it's got to be
'Cause the rhythms an addiction that I got to feed
You could say what you think that it ought to be
And pop lip to your buddies
Just not with me
Okay?
'Cause I'm heavy with the track drums
Cat with the boom bap back in action
Slap all your crew back to a fraction
Rap like a Wu pack on my back, son
And they do 'cause the rep stay solid and true
We ought to be probably stopped it 'fore we do
Something stupid and ridiculous
Looking so sick of this
Stupid moving music to the life and death until your breath is gone"
"Coming at you


Yo, peep the style and the kids checking for it
The number one question is how could you ignore it
We drop right back in the cut over basement tracks
With raps that got you backing this up like rewind that

We're just rolling with the rhythm
Rise from the ashes of stylistic division
With these non-stop lyrics of life living
Not to be forgotten but still unforgiven

But in the meantime there are those
Who wanna talk this and that
So I suppose
That it gets to a point where feelings gotta get hurt
And get dirty with the people spreading the dirt

It goes


(Try to give you warning
But everyone ignores me)
Told you everything loud and clear
(But nobody's listening)
(Call to you so clearly)
(But you don't want to hear me)
Told you everything loud and clear
(But nobody's listening)


I got a heart full of pain, head full of stress
Handful of anger held in my chest
And everything left's a waste of time
I hate my rhymes, but hate everyone else's more

I'm riding on the back of this pressure
Guessing that it's better I can't keep myself together
Because all of this stress gave me something to write on
The pain gave me something I could set my sights on

You never forget the blood sweat and tears
The up-hill struggle over years the fear and
Trash talking and the people it was to
And the people that started it just like you


(Try to give you warning
But everyone ignores me)
Told you everything loud and clear
(But nobody's listening)
(Call to you so clearly)
(But you don't want to hear me)
Told you everything loud and clear
(But nobody's listening)


I got a heart full of pain, head full of stress
Handful of anger held in my chest
Up-hill struggle
Blood sweat and tears
Nothing to gain
Everything to fear

Heart full of pain [3x]

"What do I do to ignore them behind me?
Do I follow my instincts blindly?
Do I hide my pride from these bad dreams?
And give in to sad thoughts that are maddening?

Do I sit here and try to stand it,
Or do I try to catch them red-handed?
Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness,
Or do I trust nobody and live in loneliness?

Because I can't hold on when I'm stretched so thin
I make the right moves but I'm lost within
I put on my daily faÃ§ade but then
I just end up getting hurt again by myself


(myself)
I ask why
(but in my mind I find)
I can't rely on myself
(myself)
I ask why
(but in my mind I find)
I can't rely on myself


I can't hold on
(to what I want when I'm stretched so thin)
It's all too much to take in
I can't hold on
(to anything watching everything spin)
With thoughts of failure sinking in


If I turn my back I'm defenseless
And to go blindly seems senseless
If I hide my pride and let it all go on
Then they'll take from me 'til everything is gone

If I let them go I'll be outdone
But if I try to catch them I'll be outrun
If I'm killed by the questions like a cancer
Then I'll be buried in the silence of the answer by myself


(myself)
I ask why
(but in my mind I find)
I can't rely on myself

How do you think I've lost so much?
I'm so afraid that I'm out of touch
How do you expect I will know what to do
When all I know is what you tell me to?


Don't you (know)
I can't tell you how to make it (go)
No matter what I do, how hard I (try)
I can't seem to convince myself (why)
I'm stuck on the outside

"Sometime, sometime, sometime, sometime
(Hybrid, Linkin Park)

I've been digging into crates, ever since I was livin' in space
Before the rat race, before monkeys had human traits
I mastered numerology and Big Bang theology
Performed lobotomies with telekinetic psychology
Invented the mic, so I could start blessin' it
Chin-checkin' kids to make my point like an impressionist
Many men have tried to shake us, but I twist mic cords to
Double helixes and show them what I'm made of
I buckle knees like leg braces
Cast a spell of instrumentalists on all of you emcees who hate us
So you can try on, leave you without a shoulder to cry on
From now to infinity, let icons be bygones
I fire bomb, ghostly notes haunt this
I tried threats, but moved on to a promise
I stomp shit with or without an accomplice
And run the gauntlet with whoever that wants this

High voltage
This is the unforgettable sound
High voltage
Bringing you up and taking you down
High voltage
Coming at you from every side
High voltage
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide

(Akira) I put a kink in the backbones of clones with microphones
Never satisfy my rhyme jones
Sprayin' bright day over what you might say
My blood type's Krylon, technicolor, type A
On highways, write with road rage
Pages of wind and cages of tin that bounce all around
Surround sound, devouring the scene
Subliminal gangrene, paintings, overall the same things
Sing-song, karaoke, copy bullshit
Break bones verbally with sticks and stone tactics
Fourth dimension, combat convention
Write rhymes at ease while the track stands at attention
Meant to put you away with the pencil pistol
Official sixteen line the rhyme missile
While you risk your all, I pick out all your flaws
Spittin' raw blah blah blah, you can say you saw

This is the unforgettable sound
High voltage
Bringing you up and taking you down

Coming at you from every side

Who's the man demanding you hand over your Land Rover
No man's bolder than Pharoahe when he jams your plan's over
I inflict sclerosis; the most ferocious
When I spy my third eye's extremely high voltage
That's why I need ruby quartz glasses
'Cause when I glance there's a chance that I might blast the masses
Subliminals, transmitted through piano
Integrated in flow, calculated in nano
I use skills when I need, please heed the rhyme I heal
When I bleed when I proceed through time
I walk through walls and inanimate obstacles
By inducing a reduction of cells and molecules
I bring the knowledge, you swallow a steak, that's a hologram
I boxed your head, fattened your lip like Collagen
A telepath, deliver verses with no postage
Pharoahe Monch, Mike Shinoda, we high voltage

High voltage
This is the unforgettable sound

Bringing you up and taking you down

"In this farewell
There's no blood
There's no alibi
'Cause I've drawn regret
From the truth
Of a thousand lies

So let mercy come
And wash away...

What I've done
I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done

Put to rest
What you thought of me
While I clean this slate
With the hands
Of uncertainty

So let mercy come
And wash away...

What I've done
I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done

Done I'll start again
And whatever pain may come
Today this ends
I'm forgiving what I've

Done
I'll face myself
To cross out what I've become
Erase myself
And let go of what I've done
What I've done"
"Crawling in my skin

Crawling in my skin
Without a sense of confidence
Consuming, confusing
Crawling in my skin
Without a sense of confidence
I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take
There's something inside me
That pulls beneath the surface

Crawling in my skin
Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Fear is how I fall
Confusing, confusing what is real
Confusing what is real

There's something inside me
That pulls beneath the surface
Consuming, confusing
This lack of self-control
I fear is never ending
Controlling, I can't seem
To find myself again
My walls are closing in
Without a sense of confidence
I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take
I've felt this way before
So insecure

Crawling in my skin
These wounds, they will not heal
Fear is how I fall
Confusing what is real

Discomfort endlessly has pulled itself upon me
Distracting, reacting
Against my will, I stand beside my own reflection
It's haunting
How I can't seem
To find myself again
My walls are closing in
Without a sense of confidence
I'm convinced that there's just too much pressure to take
I've felt this way before
So insecure

"Uh, yeah

Why does it feel like night today?
Something in hereâs not right today
Why am I so uptight today?
Paranoiaâs all I got left
I donât know what stressed me first
Or how the pressure was fed
But I know just what it feels like
To have a voice in the back of my head
Itâs like a face that I hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face that watches everytime I lie
A face that laughs everytime I fall
And watches everything
So, know that when itâs time to sink or swim
That the face inside is hearing me
Right underneath my skin

Itâs like Iâm paranoid looking over my back
Itâs like a whirlwind inside of my head
Itâs like I canât stop what Iâm hearing within
Itâs like a face inside thatâs right beneath my skin

Hey, yo
Here we go again with the pain I feel isnât real
But in my mind, I find myself in places with names but not faces
My memory races at speeds
Hundred degrees
My soul bleeds, devil mustâve planted the seed
Now it feels like my backâs against the wall
Iâm taking the fall
Whenever I call nobodyâs responding at all
But I donât know who I can trust
The screaming my name
I need somebody to help me out of the frame
All Iâm trying to do is just master me
All I want to do is smoke a blast-to-beat
But something keeps talking to me
Consciously, responsibly, keeps haunting me from dusk âtil dawn
Everything has something for you
That voice inside of your head got you projecting paranoia
Cold sweat shining on your face
Exposing your purpose
And if I ripped off your skin Iâd probably find another person
Thereâs nothing worse than trying to bring yourself on back from the dead
So I advise you: listen to that voice in the back of your head 

Itâs like Iâm paranoid looking over my back
Itâs like a whirlwind inside of my head
Itâs like I canât stop what Iâm hearing within
Itâs like a face inside thatâs right beneath my skin

Itâs like Iâm paranoid looking over my back
Itâs like a whirlwind inside of my head
Itâs like I canât stop what Iâm hearing within
Itâs like a face inside thatâs right beneath my skin

The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin
The face inside is right beneath your skin

The sun goes down
I feel the light betray me
The sun goes down
Itâs like Iâm paranoid
I feel the light betray me
The sun goes down
Canât stop what Iâm hearing within
Itâs like the face inside is right beneath my skin

Itâs like Iâm paranoid looking over my back
Itâs like a whirlwind inside of my head
Itâs like I canât stop what Iâm hearing within
Itâs like a face inside thatâs right beneath my skin

Itâs like Iâm paranoid looking over my back

Itâs like I canât stop what Iâm hearing within
Itâs like a face inside thatâs right beneath my skin"
"""We knew the world would not be the same. Few people laughed, few people cried, most people were silent. I remembered the line from the Hindu scripture, the Bhagavad-Gita. Vishnu is trying to persuade the Prince that he should do his duty and to impress him takes on his multi-armed form and says, ""Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds."" I suppose we all thought that, one way or another.""

Sharp edges have consequences, I
Guess that I had to find out for myself
Sharp edges have consequences, now
Every scar is a story I can tell

Should've played it safer from the start
Loved you like a house of cards
Let it fall apart
But all the things I couldn't understand
Never could've planned
They made me who I am
Put your nose in paperbacks
Instead of smoking cigarettes
These are years you're never getting back

Saying everything I've said before

Tell me what's worth fighting for

But it's like no matter what I do, I can't convince you to just believe this is real
So I let go watching you turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that I'm not
I'll be here 'cause you're all that I got


Got a condo with nothing but condoms in it
The same place where the rhymes is invented
So all I do is rap and sex, imagine how I stroke
See how I was flowin' on my last cassette?
Rapid-fire like I'm blastin' a Tec, never jam though
Never get high, never run out of ammo
Niggaz hatin' the shit 'cause I slayed your bitch
You know your favorite, I know it made you sick
And now you're actin' raw but you never had war
Don't know how to carry your hoes, wanna marry your ho
Now she's mad at me, 'cause Your Majesty, just happened to be a pimp. What a tragedy
She wanted us to end 'cause I fucked with friends
She gave me one more chance and I fucked her again
I seen her tears as she busted in
I said, ""Shit... there's a draft, shut the door, bitch, and come on in!""


I am a little bit insecure a little unconfident
'Cause you don't understand I do what I can but sometimes I don't make sense
I am what you never wanna say but I've never had a doubt
It's like no matter what I do I can't convince you for once just to hear me out
So I let go watching you turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that I'm not
I'll be here 'cause you're all that I've got


I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored

Now
Hear me out now
You're gonna listen to me, like it or not
Right now
Hear me out now
You're gonna listen to me, like it or not
Right now

I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored

I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored

I can't feel
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored
Time won't heal
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored"
"When I pretend, everything is what I want it to be
I look exactly like what you had always wanted to see
When I pretend, I can forget about the criminal I am
Stealing second after second just 'cause I know I can


But I can't pretend this is the way it'll stay
I'm just (trying to bend the truth)
I can't pretend I'm who you want me to be
So I'm (lying my way from you)

No, no turning back now
(I wanna be pushed aside, so, let me go)
No, no turning back now
(Let me take back my life)
(I'd rather be all alone)
No turning back now
(Anywhere on my own)
('Cause I can see)
No, no turning back now
(The very worst part of you is me)


I remember what they taught to me
Remember condescending talk of who I ought to be
Remember listening to all of that and this again
So I pretended up a person who was fittin' in


And now you think this person really is me
And I'm (trying to bend the truth)
But the more I push the more I'm pulling away
'Cause I'm (lying my way from you)

No, no turning back now
(I wanna be pushed aside, so, let me go)
No, no turning back now
(Let me take back my life)
(I'd rather be all alone)
No turning back now
(Anywhere on my own)
('Cause I can see)
No, no turning back now
(The very worst part of you)
(The very worst part of you is me)


This isn't what I wanted to be
I never thought that what I said would have you running from me
Like this


(You)
No turning back now
(I wanna be pushed aside, so, let me go)
No, no turning back now
(Let me take back my life)
(I'd rather be all alone)
No turning back now

No, no turning back now

"A-one, a-two, a-one, two, three, four
Uh, this song's about jellyfish
And their bellyfish
Ain't no foolyfish
I don't droolyfish
Goes like this:

Jelly, jelly, jellyfish
When you squeeze me, I go squish
Peanut butter jellyfish
Put me onto your sandwich

Said jelly, jelly, jellyfish
When you squeeze me, I go squish
'Cause I'm a jellyfish
I'm a jellyfish

My friends are fish and they go to school
They think I'm crazy and they think I'm cool
'Cause I'm a jellyfish
I'm a jellyfish

Jelly, jelly, jellyfish
When you squeeze me, I go squish
'Cause I'm a jellyfish
I'm a jellyfish

Got no eyes, I got no head
I've got no house, I got no bed
'Cause I'm a jellyfish
I'm a jellyfish

"You know what I mean
You could put a label on a life
Put a label on a lifestyle

Sometimes...

You know
Put a label on how you wake up every morning
And go to bed at night

Hybrid

I've been digging into crates ever since I was living in space
Before the rat race, before monkeys had human traits
I mastered numerology and Big Bang theology
Performed lobotomies with telekinetic psychology

Invented the mic so I could start blessing it
Chin-checking kids to make my point like an impressionist
Many men have tried to shake us
But I twist mic cords to double helixes and show them what I'm made of

I buckle knees like leg braces
Cast the spell of instrumentalness
And all of you MCs who hate us
So you can try on
Leave you without a shoulder to cry on
From now to infinity let icons be bygones

I fire bomb ghostly notes haunt this
I tried threats but moved on to a promise
I stomp shit with or without an accomplice
And run the gauntlet with whoever that wants this

High voltage
The unforgettable sound
High voltage
Bringing you up and taking you down
High voltage
Coming at you from every side
High voltage
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide

Akira
I put a kink in the backbones of clones
With microphones
Never satisfy my rhyme jones
Spraying bright day
Over what you might say
My blood type's Krylon
Technicolor type A

On highways ride with road rage
Cages of wind
And cages of tin
That bounce all around
Surround sound

Devouring the scene
Subliminal gangrene
Paintings
Overall the same thing

Sing song karaoke copy bullshit
Break bones verbally with sticks-and-stone tactics
Fourth dimension
Combat convention
Write rhymes at ease while the track stands at attention

Meant to put you away with the pencil
Pistol, official
16 line a rhyme missile
While you risk your all
I pick out all your flaws
Spin rah blah blah blah
You can say you saw

High voltage
The unforgettable sound
High voltage
Bringing you up and taking you down
High voltage
Coming at you from every side
High voltage
Making the rhythm and rhyme collide

And like the rock and rap
You know what I mean
People act like you know
Wow that's a new invention
That shit's brand new
We're constantly evolving
It is constantly changing

Sometimes...

There's a lot of change
Everybody's always up with labels
There ain't no label for this shit
They're always gonna try to put a label on it
Try to create something
So they can water it down

[2x]
Sometimes I feel like a prophet
Misunderstood
Under the gun like a new disease

Do you tell yourself ""I don't realize""?

Your crusade's a disguise
Replace freedom with fear, you trade money for lives

I'm aware of what you've done

No, no more sorrow
I've paid for your mistakes
Your time is borrowed
Your time has come to be replaced

I see pain, I see need
I see liars and thieves abuse power with greed

I had hope, I believed
But I'm beginning to think that I've been deceived

You will pay for what you've done

"You say you're not gonna fight
'Cause no one would fight for you
And you think there's not enough love
And no one to give it to
And you're sure you've hurt for so long
You've got nothing left to lose
So you say you're not gonna fight
'Cause no one would fight for you

You say the weight of the world
Has kept you from letting go
And you think compassion's a flaw
And you'll never let it show
And you're sure you've hurt in a way
That no one will ever know
But someday the weight of the world
Will give you the strength to go

Hold on, the weight of the world
Will give you the strength to go
So hold on, the weight of the world
Will give you the strength to go
So hold on, the weight of the world
Will give you the strength to go
Just hold on, the weight of the world

"I am not a pattern to be followed
The pill that I'm on is a tough one to swallow
I'm not a criminal, not a role model
Not a born leader, I'm a tough act to follow
I am not the fortune and the fame
Or the same person telling you to forfeit the game
I came in the ring like a dog on a chain and then found out the underbelly's sicker than it seems
And it seems ugly but it can get worse
'Cause even a blueprint is a gift and a curse
'Cause once you got a theory of how the thing works
Everybody wants the next thing to be just like the first
And I'm not a robot, I'm not a monkey
I will not dance even if the beat's funky
Opposite of lazy, far from a punk
Ya'll oughta stop talking
Start trying to catch up, motherfucker

And all the people say
Try to catch up, motherfucker

Lauryn said money change the situation
Big said it increase the complication
Kane said don't step, I ain't the one
Chuck said an Uzi weigh a motherfucking ton
And I'm just a student of the game that they taught me
Rocking every stage and every place that they brought me
I'm awfully underrated but came here to correct it
And so it ain't mistaken, I'mma say it for the record
I am the opposite of wack, opposite of weak
Opposite of slack, synonym of heat, synonym of crack
Closest to a peak, far from a punk
Ya'll oughta stop talking, start trying to catch up motherfucker

And all the people say
Try to catch up, motherfucker

When they come for me, come for me I'll be gone [3x]

And all the people say

"Myself
Myself

What do I do to ignore them behind me?
Do I follow my instincts blindly?
Do I hide my pride from these bad dreams
And give in to sad thoughts that are maddening?
Do I sit here and try to stand it?
Or do I try to catch them red-handed?
Do I trust some and get fooled by phoniness?
Or do I trust nobody and live in loneliness?
Because I can't hold on when I'm stretched so thin
I make the right moves but I'm lost within
I put on my daily facade but then
I just end up getting hurt again

By myself
Myself
I ask why
But in my mind I find
I can't rely on myself
Myself
I ask why
But in my mind I find
I can't rely on myself

I can't look around
It's too much to take in
I can't hold back
When I'm stretched so thin
I can't slow down
Watching everything spin
I can't look back
Starting over again

If I turn my back I'm defenseless
And to go blindly seems senseless
If I hide my pride and let it all go on
Then they'll take from me 'til everything is gone
If I let them go I'll be outdone
But if I try to catch them I'll be outrun
If I'm killed by the questions like a cancer
Then I'll be buried in the silence of the answer

"It goes a one, two, three...

I was born with the hunger of a lion, the strength of a sun
I don't need to sweat it when a competition come
Original style like an 808 drum
So I don't run the track no, I make the track run
My mama taught me words, my daddy built rockets
I put 'em both together, now tell me what I got,
It's a pretty smart weapon, I can shoot it, I can drop it
But learn to respect it 'cause you clearly can't stop it
Like that

It ain't over
'Cause the shark's on the left side, the snake's on the right
And anything you do, they wanna get a little bite
It really doesn't matter if you're wrong or if you're right
'Cause once they get their teeth in, nothing really fights
And as for me, I do it like I got nothin' to lose
Now you can run your mouth like you could try to fill my shoes
But steady, little soldier, I ain't standing next to you
I'd be laying on the ground before you're even in my view
Like that"
"(yeah) (yo)
You were that foundation
Never gonna be another one, no.
I followed, so taken
So conditioned I could never let go
Then sorrow, then sickness
Then the shock when you flip it on me
So hollow, so vicious
So afraid I couldn't let myself see
That I could never be held
Back or up no, I'll hold myself
Check the rep, yep you know mine well
Forget the rest let them know my hell
There and back yet my soul ain't sell
Kept respect up,the best they fell,
Let the rest be the tale they tell
That I was there sayingâ¦

Deep below
Each word gets lost in the echo
So one last lie I can see through
This time I finally let you
Go, go, go.

Test my will, test my heart
Let me tell you how the odds gonna stack up
Y'all go hard, I go smart
How's that working out for y'all in the back, huh?
I've seen that frustration
Been crossed and lost and told, ""No.""
And I've come back unshaken
Let down and lived and let go
So you can let it be known
I don't hold back, I hold my own
I can't be mapped, I can't be cloned
I can't C-flat, it ain't my tone
I can't fall back, I came too far
Hold myself up and love my scars
Let the bells ring wherever they are
'Cause I was there saying...

This time I finally let you go!
Go, go, go.

No, you can tell 'em all now
I don't back up, I don't back down
I don't fold up, and I don't bow
I don't roll over, don't know how

Can't be stopped, all I know; go hard
Won't forget how I got this far

"In this desert,
In darkness,
Lying with the gun across his chest.
Pretending,
He's heartless,
As the fire flashes in the sky.
He was fragile,
And frozen,
When the bullet took away his friend.
And now he's somehow,
More broken.

He's pulling his weapon to his side,
Loading it full of his goodbyes,
Holding an enemy across the line.
He's pulling his weapon to his side,
Loading it full of his goodbyes,
Holding an enemy across the line.

Sweating,
And shaking,
Lying with her hands across her chest.
She wakes with,
Her cravings,
As the fire flashes in her eye.
She was fragile,
And frozen,
When the needle took away her friend,
But now she's somehow,
More broken.

She's pulling her weapon to her side,
Loading it full of her goodbyes,
Holding an enemy across the line.

To make it so I'm standing right here

Now, now see if I don't get right back up

Give you what you need like papa, who shot you

You're the meek, I creep hard on impostors
And switch styles on a dime, quick-witted y'all
Quit tripping, I don't have time for your crying
I grind tough, sucker, make your mind up
Are you in the firing squad or are you in the line-up?

Bang, bang, little monkey man playing
With the big guns only get you slain
I ain't playing, I'm just saying
You ain't got a sliver of a chance
I get iller, I deliver while you quiver in your pants
So shake, shake down, money, here's the break-down
You can play the bank, I'mma play the bank take-down

I'm just a Banksy, you're a Brainwash, get the picture?
It's like that"
"It starts with one

One thing I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time


All I know
 Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away


It's so unreal

It's so unreal, didn't look out below
Watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, but didn't even know
I wasted it all just to watch you go


Watch you go

I kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when I tried so hard


I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter


One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To remind myself how I tried so hard


I tried so hard

In spite of the way you were mocking me
Acting like I was part of your property
Remembering all the times you fought with me
I'm surprised it got so far


Got so far

Things aren't the way they were before
You wouldn't even recognize me anymore
Not that you knew me back then
But it all comes back to me in the end


In the end

You kept everything inside and even though I tried, it all fell apart
What it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when I tried so hard


I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter"
"Yeah here we go for the hundredth time
Hand grenade pins in every line
Throw 'em up and let something shine
Going out of my fucking mind

Filthy mouth, no excuse
Find a new place to hang this noose
String me up from atop these roofs
Knot it tight so I won't get loose

Truth is you can stop and stare
Bled myself out and no one cares
Dug the trench out laid down there
With a shovel up out of reach somewhere

Yeah, someone pour it in
Make it a dirt dance floor again
Say your prayers and stomp it out
When they bring that chorus in


I bleed it out digging deeper
Just to throw it away
I bleed it out digging deeper
Just to throw it away
I bleed it out digging deeper
Just to throw it away
Just to throw it away
Just to throw it away
I bleed it out


Go stop the show
Choppy words and a sloppy flow
Shotgun opera lock and load
Cock it back and then watch it go

Mama help me I've been cursed
Death is rolling in every verse
Candy paint on his brand new hearse
Can't contain him he knows he works

Fuck this hurts, I won't lie
Doesn't matter how hard I try
Half the words don't mean a thing
And I know that I won't be satisfied

So why try ignoring him?
Make it a dirt dance floor again
Say your prayers and stomp it out
When they bring that chorus in


I bleed it out digging deeper
Just to throw it away
I bleed it out digging deeper
Just to throw it away
I bleed it out digging deeper
Just to throw it away
Just to throw it away
Just to throw it away
I bleed it out

I've opened up these scars
I'll make you face this
I've pulled myself so far
I'll make you face this now!

I bleed it out digging deeper
Just to throw it away
I bleed it out digging deeper
Just to throw it away
I bleed it out digging deeper
Just to throw it away
Just to throw it away
Just to throw it away

I bleed it out digging deeper
Just to throw it away
I bleed it out digging deeper
Just to throw it away
I bleed it out digging deeper
Just to throw it away
Just to throw it away
Just to throw it away

I bleed it out
I bleed it out
I bleed it out"
"There's a time when the operation of the machine becomes so odious, makes you so sick at heart, that you can't take part; you can't even passively take part, and you've got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels, upon the levers, upon all the apparatus, and you've got to make it stop.


To save face / how low can you go
Talk a lot of game but yet you don't know
Static on the way / make us all say whoa
The people up top push the people down low
Get down
And obey every word
Steady getting mine if you haven't yet heard
Wanna take what I got / don't be absurd
Don't fight the power / nobody gets hurt
If you haven't heard yet then I'm letting you know
There ain't shit we don't run when the guns unload
And no one make a move unless my people say so
Got everything outta control
Now everybody go


Steel unload / final blow
We the animals take control
Hear us now / clear and true
Wretches and kings we come for you


So keep pace / how slow can you go
Talk a lot of shit and yet you don't know
Fire on the way / make you all say whoa
The people up top and the people down low
Get down
And I'm running it like that
The front of the attack is exactly where I'm at
Somewhere in between the kick and the hi hat
The pen and the contract
The pitch and the contact
So get with the combat / I'm letting 'em know
There ain't shit you can say to make me back down no
So / push the button let the whole thing blow
Spinning everything outta control
Now everybody go


Steel unload / final blow
We the animals take control
Hear us now / clear and true
Wretches and kings we come for you

Steel unload / fire blow
Filthy animals / beat them low
Skin and bone / black and blue
No more this sun shall beat onto you


From the front to the back and the side to side
If you fear what I feel put 'em up real high
[6x]

And you've got to indicate to the people who run it, to the people who own it, that unless you're free, the machine will be prevented from working at all."
"Today
We stood on the wall
We laughed at the sun
We laughed at the guns
We laughed at it all
And when they
They told us to go
We paid them no mind
Like every other time
But little did we know


Today
I looked for a sign
With flames in my hands
A line in the sand
Between yours and mine
And it came
Like fire from below
Your greed led the call
My flag had to fall
But little did you know


Another day
Your truth will come
You're gonna pay for what you'veâ
Pay for what you've done
You'll get what's yours
And face your crime
You'll tell them give me back what's mine
Give me back what's mine


I had never been a coward
I had never seen blood
You had sold me an ocean
And I was lost in the flood
We were counting on a leader
We were driven by need
But couldn't take temptation
And we were blinded by greed
You were steady as a sniper
We were waiting on a wire
So we never saw it coming
When you ran from the fire
You can try intimidation
And you can try to ignore
But when the time comes calling, yeah
You are gonna get yours


Another day
Your truth will come
You're gonna pay for what you'veâ
Pay for what you've done
You'll get what's yours
And face your crime
You'll tell them give me back what's mine
Give me back what's mine

And so today
Your truth has come
You're gonna pay for what you'veâ
Pay for what you've done
You'll get what's yours
You're out of time
And you will give me back what's mine
Give me back what's mine

Give me
Give me back what's mine
Give me
Give me back what's mine
What's mine
Give me
Give me back what's mine
What's mine
What's mine
Give me back what's mine


Today we stood on the wall
We laughed at the sun
We laughed at the guns
We laughed at it all
And when they
They told us to go
We paid them no mind
Like every other time

"Nah, you don't know me
Lightning above and a fire below me
You cannot catch me, cannot hold me
You cannot stop, much less control me
When it rains, it pours
When the floodgates open, brace your shores
That pressure don't care when it breaks your doors
Say it's all you can take, better take some more

(Oh)
'Cause I know what it's like to test fate
Had my shoulders pressed with that weight
Stood up strong in spite of that hate

(Oh)
Night gets darkest right before dawn
What don't kill you makes you more strong
And I been waiting for it so long

The nights go on
Waiting for a light that never comes
I chase the sun
Waiting for a light that never comes
(Oh) (Oh) (Oh)
Waiting for a light that never comes

When I was young, they told me, they said
Make your bed, you lie in that bed
A king can only reign 'til instead
There comes that day it's ""off with his head""

(Oh)
Night gets darkest right before dawn
What don't kill you makes you more strong
You'll have my mercy then when you're gone

The nights go on
Waiting for a light that never comes
I chase the sun
Waiting for a light that never comes
(Oh) (Oh) (Oh)
Waiting for a light that never comes

"Where should I start
Disjointed heart
I've got no commitment
To my own flesh and blood
Left all alone
Far from my home
No one to hear me, to heal my ill heart, I

Keep it locked up inside

Cannot express
To the point I've regressed
If anger's a gift, then I guess I've been blessed, I

Keep it locked up inside
Keep my distance from your lies

It's too late to love me now
You have never shown me
It's too late to love me now
You don't even know me

Breaking a part of my heart to find release
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace
Breaking a part of my heart to find release
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace

Breaking a part of my heart to find release (Break)
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace (Me)
Breaking a part of my heart to find release (Too)
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace

Breaking a part of my heart to find release (Too)
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace
Breaking a part of my heart to find release
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace
Breaking a part of my heart to find release
Taking you out of my blood to bring me peace

Keep my distance
Keep my distance
Keep my distance
Keep my distance

Spit drips from the jaw of the witless witness
Cryptic colloquialisms shift your mid rift
Dog-paddle through a bog of shadows and smog
With my thought catalog, analog, rap battle log
Keep my distance, and fear resistance, hurt by persistence
The twisted web of tangled lies strangles my hope to waste and numbs the taste
And I'm forced to face these hate crimes against the state of being, feeling the weightlessness, press me to the ceiling, reeling around rooms, riding a bubble of sound
Tuned to the frequency making your chest shake with every boom, involuntary muscle contraction
Ignoring your neck's breaking, musical gas fume euphoria
The sound pounds to make the dead flush
To hand you a head rush with read rhymes and said stuff"

"I've got an aching head
Echoes and buzzing noises
I know the words we said
But wish I could've turned our voices down
This is not black and white
Only organized confusion
I'm just trying to get it right
And in spite of all I should've done

I was not mad at you
I was not trying to tear you down
The words that I could've used
I was too scared to say out loud
If I cannot break your fall
I'll pick you up right off the ground
If you felt invisible, I won't let you feel that now

Invisible

You didn't get your way
And it's an empty feeling
You've got a lot to say
And you just want to know you're being heard

"Writing with a head full of buckets of red
And what I said is still stuck in my head
A thoroughbred, thoroughly bled,
And led to the land of the never-come-backs
Smaller than a thumbtack, and they never run from that
From planetary signs, rising over the horizon,
Smaller than a fly's head
I'm a lyrical lamb, the power of a god
In my cynical hand
With a pen, once again swimmin'
In the centre of a hit or a miss
Reeling in my thoughts gettin' lost in the mist
Realise that one the size of the fist
And the killin' of a killer with a flick of the wrist

I wanna live in another place
Where no one can say that I,
Live for them
(Still I see that it's not meant to be for me)
I wanna be in the energy
Not with the enemy
A place for my head

And the second is gone
The weapon of time is stronger than a nuclear bomb
Eternity or half-life
Somethin' that math can't write
You can't fight nor flee
Still be around if it wasn't for me
Weigh that, verse whatever, my friends
So you can see the attraction of the payback
Don't want me to say that?
Play back the thing now, gettin' lost in the chaos
Tossin' it down,

Singin' again to myself
Electric neck twitch
Hungry for a head full of hectic
Accept this, doing double-duty on time
Adding to the panic of my confine

Singin' again to myself
Electric neck twitch
Hungry for a head full of hectic
Accept this, doing double-duty on time
Adding to the panic of my confine

Soon the Aztec moon will heat my room heal my wounds [8x]

"I watch how the moon sits in the sky in the dark night
Shining with the light from the sun
And the sun doesn't give light to the moon assuming
The moon's gonna owe it one

It makes me think of how you act for me
You do favors and then rapidly
Just turn around and start asking me
About things that you want back from me

I'm sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest


I wanna be in another place
I hate when you say you don't understand
(You'll see it's not meant to be)
I wanna be in the energy,
Not with the enemy
A place for my head


Maybe someday I'll be just like you
And step on people like you do
And run away of the people I thought I knew
I remember back then who you were

You used to be calm, used to be strong
Used to be generous but you should've known
That you'd wear out your welcome
And now you see how quiet it is, all alone


I'm so sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed
While I find a place to rest

I'm so sick of the tension, sick of the hunger
Sick of you acting like I owe you this
Find another place to feed your greed

Go away

I wanna be in the energy,
Not with the enemy

"It goes a one
It goes a one, two, three


I was born with the hunger of a lion, the strength of a sun
I don't need to sweat it when the competition come
Original style like an 808 drum
So I don't run the track, no, I make the track run
My mama taught me words, my dad, he built rockets
I put 'em both together now, tell me what I got
it's a pretty smart weapon, I can shoot it, I can drop it
But learn to respect it 'cause you clearly can't stop it
Like that

It ain't over
'cause the shark's on the left side, the snake's on the right
And anything you do, they wanna get a little bite
It really doesn't matter if you're wrong or if you're right
'Cause once you get the teeth in, nothing really fights
Except for me, I do it like I got nothing to lose
And you can run your mouth like you could try to fill my shoes
But steady, little soldier, I ain't standing next to you
I'll be laying on the ground before you're even in my view
Like that


Give me the strength of the rising sun
Give me the truth of the words unsung
And when the last bells ring
The poor men sing
""Bring me to kingdom come.""


This is something for your people on the block to black out and rock to
Give you what you need like Poppa, who shot you
""Separate the weak from the obsolete.""
You're the meek, I creep hard on impostors
And switch styles on a dime, quick-witted y'all
Quit tripping, I don't have time for your crying
I grind tough, sucker, make your mind up
Are you in the firing squad or are you in the line-up?
Bang, bang, little monkey man playing
With the big guns only get you slain
I ain't playing, I'm just saying
You ain't got a sliver of a chance
I get iller, I deliver while you quiver in your pants
So shake, shake down, money, here's the break-down
You can play the bank, I'mma play the bank take-down
And no mistakes now, I'm coming to get you
I'm just a Banksy, you're a Brainwash, get the picture?
It's like that


We swim against the rising waves
And crash against the shore
The body bends until it breaks
The early morning sings no more
So rest your head, it's time to sleep
And dream of what's in store
The body bends until it breaks
Then sings again no more
'Cause time has torn the flesh away
The early morning sings no more"
"Wait at the turn [15x]
Wait-ait-ait

Wait at the turn [14x]
Whoa

We're building it up
To break it back down

"Yeah!
Yo!
This is not the end, this is not the beginning
Just a voice like a riot rocking every revision
But you listen to the tone and the violent rhythm
And though the words sound steady something empty's within them
We say yeah with fists flying up in the air
Like we're holding onto something that's invisible there
'Cause we're living at the mercy of the pain and the fear
Until we get it, forget it, let it all disappear


Waiting for the end to come
Wishing I had strength to stand
This is not what I had planned
It's out of my control
Flying at the speed of light
Thoughts were spinning in my head
So many things were left unsaid
It's hard to let you go

(Oh) I know what it takes to move on
(Oh) I know how it feels to lie
(Oh) All I wanna do
Is trade this life for something new
Holding on to what I haven't got

Sitting in an empty room
Trying to forget the past
This was never meant to last
I wish it wasn't so

(Oh) I know what it takes to move on
(Oh) I know how it feels to lie
(Oh) All I wanna do
Is trade this life for something new
Holding on to what I haven't got

(Yeah, yeah!)


What was left when that fire was gone?
I thought it felt right but that right was wrong
All caught up in the eye of the storm
And trying to figure out what it's like moving on
And I don't even know what kind of things I said
My mouth kept moving and my mind went dead
So I'm picking up the pieces, now where to begin
The hardest part of ending is starting again

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ohâ¦


All I want to do
Is trade this life for something new
Holding on to what I haven't got
I'm holding on to what I haven't got
I'm holding on to what I haven't got

Crumbling down, it's so unreal


It's so unreal

They're dealing you in to determine your end
And sending you back again, the places you've been
And bending your will 'til it breaks you within
And still they fill their eyes


Fill their eyes

With the twilight through the skylight
And the highlights on a frame of steel
See the brightness of your likeness
As I write this on a pad with the way I feel


The way I feel

Hear the screaming in my dreaming
As it's seeming that you've played your part
Like you're heartless, take apart this
In the darkness but I know that I tried so hard


I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter


I've looked down the line
And what's there is not what ought to be
Held back by the battles they fought for me
Calling me to be part of their property
And now I see that I get no chance


Get no chance

I get no break
Fakes and snakes quickly lead to mistakes
And as the tightrope within
Slowly starts to thin
I can only hope that they close their eyes


Close their eyes

To the twilight through the skylight
And the highlights on a frame of steel
See the brightness of your likeness
As I write this on a pad to the way I feel


The way I feel

Hear the screaming in my dreaming
As it's seeming that you've played your part
Like you're heartless, take apart this
In the darkness, but I know that I tried so hard


I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

I've put my trust in you
Pushed as far as I can go
For all this
There's only one thing you should know

I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter"
"There are just too many times that people have tried to look inside of me
Wondering what I think of you and I protect you out of courtesy
Too many times that I've held on when I needed to push away
Afraid to say what was on my mind, afraid to say what I need to say

Too many things that you've said about me when I'm not around
You think having the upper hand means you gotta keep putting me down

But I've had too many stand-offs with you, it's about as much as I can stand
So I'm waiting until the upper hand is mine


(One minute you're on top)
The next you're not, watch it drop
(Making your heart stop)
Just before you hit the floor
(One minute you're on top)
The next you're not, missed your shot
(Making your heart stop)
You think you won
(And then it's all gone)


So many people like me put so much trust in all your lies
So concerned with what you think to just say what we feel inside
So many people like me walk on eggshells all day long
All I know is that all I want is to feel like I'm not stepped on

There are so many things you say that make me feel you've crossed the line
What goes up will surely fall and I'm counting down the time

'Cause I've had so many stand-offs with you, it's about as much as I can stand
So I'm waiting until the upper hand is mine


(One minute you're on top)
The next you're not, watch it drop
(Making your heart stop)
Just before you hit the floor
(One minute you're on top)
The next you're not, missed your shot
(Making your heart stop)
You think you won
(And then it's all gone) [4x]
(Now it's all gone)


I know I'll never trust a single thing you say
You knew your lies would divide us, but you lied anyway
And all the lies have got you floating up above us all
But what goes up has got to fall


(One minute you're on top)
The next you're not, watch it drop
(Making your heart stop)
Just before you hit the floor
(One minute you're on top)
The next you're not, missed your shot
(Making your heart stop)
You think you won
(And then it's all gone) [4x]
(Now it's all gone)"
"There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch
And it's bringing me out the dark

Finally I see you crystal clear
Go ahead and sell me out
While I'll lay your shit bare

See how I'll leave with every piece of you
Don't underestimate
The things that I will do

There's a fire starting in my heart
Reaching a fever pitch
And it's bringing me out the dark

The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling

We could've had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it to the beat

Baby, I have no story to be told
But I've heard one on you
And I'm gonna make your head burn

See me in the depths of your despair
Making a home down there
'Cause mine sure won't be shared

The scars of your love remind me of us
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless
I can't help feeling

We could've had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it to the beat

We could've had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played it with a beating

Throw your soul through every open door
Count your blessings
To find what you're looking for

Turn my sorrow into treasured gold
Pay me back in time
And reap just what you sow

You're gonna wish you never had met me
Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep
You're gonna wish youâ
You could've had it all

You could've had it all
Rolling in the deep
You had my heart inside of your hand
But you played itâ
You played itâ
You played itâ
You played it to the beat"

"From the top to the bottom!
Bottom to top I stop
At the core I've forgotten
In the middle of my thoughts
Taken far from my safety!
So I'm bright in the sky
But the sun will escape me
So why did I try?

From the top to the bottom!
Bottom to top I stop
At the core I've forgotten
In the middle of my thoughts
Taken far from my safety!
So I'm bright in the sky
But the sun will escape me
So why do I try?

From the thread to the needle
Middle to end
When skies cock back and shock that which couldn't defend
The rain then sends dripping an acidic question
Forcefully, the power of suggestion
Then with the eyes tightly shut
Looking through the rust and rotten dust
A spot of light floods the floor
Pours itself upon the world of pretend
Then the eyes ease open and it's dark again

From the top to the bottom!
Bottom to top I stop
At the core I've forgotten!

In a minute you'll find me
Eyes burn me up
You say you'll never forget me
But the lies have piled up

Moving all around
Screaming of the ups and downs
Pollution manifested in perpetual sound
And as the wheels go 'round
The sunset creeps past
The street lamps, cars, chain-links and concrete
A window then grows and captures the eye
Cries out yellow light as it passes it by
A small black figure sits in front of a box
Inside a box of rock with the needles on top
Nothing stops in this land of the pain
The sane loose not knowing they where part of the game
But then the inside changes, the box stays the same in shame
Shovel up the pieces to the pain
You can try to hide yourself in this world of pretend
When the paper's crumpled up it can't be perfect again

From the top to the bottom!
Bottom to top I stop
At the core I've forgotten
In the middle of my thoughts
Taken far from my safety!
So I'm bright in the sky
But the sun will escape me
So why do I try?

"Ha ha
You're wasting your talent, Randy

Yeah
Ready?


It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right


Why does it look like night today?
Something inside's not right today
Why am I so uptight today?
Paranoia's all I got left
I don't know what stressed me first
Or how the pressure was fed
But I know just what it feels like
To have a voice in the back of my head
It's like a face that I hold inside
Face that awakes when I close my eyes
Face that watches every time they lie
Face that laughs every time they fall
And watches everything

So you know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is hearing me
Right underneath my skin


It's like I'm paranoid lookin' over my back
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
It's like I can't stop what I'm hearing within
It's like the face inside is right


You know I thug 'em, fuck 'em, love 'em, leave 'em
'Cause I don't fuckin' need 'em
Take 'em out the hood, keep 'em looking good
But I don't fuckin' feed 'em
First time they fuss I'm breezing
Talking 'bout, ""What's the reasons?""
I'm a pimp in every sense of the word, bitch
Better trust than believe 'em
In the cut where I keep 'em
'Til I need a nut, 'til I need to beat the guts
Then it's ""beep beep"" and I'm picking 'em up
Let 'em play with the dick in the truck
Many chicks wanna put Jigga fist in cuffs
Divorce him and split his bucks
Just because you got good head, I'mma break bread
So you can be living it up? Shit I...
Parts with nothing, y'all be fronting
Me? Give my heart to a woman?
Not for nothing, never happen
I'll be forever macking
Heart cold as assassins, I got no passion
I got no patience
And I hate waiting.
Hoe, get your ass in

And let's RI-I-I-I-I-IDE. Check 'em out now

"I scream at myself when there's nobody else to fight
I don't lose, I don't win, if I'm wrong, then I'm halfway right

Used to get high with the dead end kids
Abandoned houses where the shadows lived
I never been higher than I was that night
I woke up driving my car
I couldn't see then what I see right now
The road dissolving like an empty vow
Couldn't remember where I'd been that night
I knew I took it too far

All you said to do was slow down
I remember, now I remember
All you said to do was slow down
But I was already gone

I scream at myself when there's nobody else to fight
I don't lose, I don't win, if I'm wrong, then I'm halfway right
I know what I want, but it feels like I'm paralyzed
I don't lose, I don't win, if I'm wrong, then I'm halfway right (halfway right)

Told me, ""Kid, you're going way too fast
You burn too bright, you know you'll never last""
It was bullshit then, I guess it makes sense now
I woke up driving my car
Said I'd lose you if I lost control
I just laughed because what do they know?
Here I am, standing all alone
Because I took it too far

All you said to do was slow down
I remember, now I remember
All you said to do was slow down
But I was already gone

I scream at myself when there's nobody else to fight
I don't lose, I don't win, if I'm wrong, then I'm halfway right
I know what I want, but it feels like I'm paralyzed
I don't lose, I don't win, if I'm wrong, then I'm halfway right, halfway right

But I was already gone
I scream at myself when there's nobody else to fight
I don't lose, I don't win, if I'm wrong, then I'm halfway right

"You hid your skeletons when I had shown you mine
You woke the devil that I thought you'd left behind
I saw the evidence, the crimson soaking through
Ten thousand promises, ten thousand ways to lose

And you held it all
But you were careless to let it fall
You held it all
And I was by your side

Powerless

I watched you fall apart and chased you to the end.
I'm left with emptiness that words cannot defend
You'll never know what I became because of you
Ten thousand promises, ten thousand ways to lose

[2x]
And you held it all
But you were careless to let it fall
You held it all
And I was by your side

Powerless

Powerless [2x]"
"This is the first day of my last days
I built it up, now I take it apart, climbed up real high, now fall down real far
No need for me to stay, the last thing left, I just threw it away
I put my faith in God and my trust in you, now there's nothing more fucked up I could do

Wish there was something real, wish there was something true
Wish there was something real in this world, fuck you

I'm the one without a soul, I'm the one with this big fucking hole
No new tale to tell, twenty-six years, on my way to Hell
Gotta listen to your big time, hard line, bad luck, fist fuck
Don't think you're having all the fun, you know me, I hate everyone

Wish there was something real, wish there was something true
Wish there was something real in this world, fuck you

"Landing in the Devil's drop
I walked out in the snow
And climbed up to the mountain top
A push from death below

Brother fell protecting us
Somewhere far from home
Lay him down to rest with us
In fields of earth and coal

Sailing out away from this
To ports of foreign shores
Let us not forget to miss
The ones we cannot hold

And climbed up to the mountain top
A push from death below

Waste myself on you, you, you

I'll take everything from the inside
And throw it all away
'Cause I swear for the last time
I won't trust myself with you

Everything from the inside
And just throw it all away
'Cause I swear for the last time
I won't trust myself with you, you, you"
"Listen,
My blood feels like it's sitting still in my veins
My motivation was gone before it even came
Today and yesterday, they both seem the same
And no matter how I try I just can't change

Give me one reason I should go outside
Everything will be the same no matter what I try
Some people'll live and some people'll die
Some people'll build their whole life on a lie

I used to blame you for the things that I thought you'd say
So now I can't blame you for going away
Cause these memories are the blood beating under my skin
Repeating the same thoughts again and again

Again and again
(You said we couldn't last long enough or be strong enough)
Again and again
(You said our voices weren't loud enough but we've had enough because)
We want our future back
We want our own mistakes
To take our own path
We wanna do it again

Again and again
(You said we couldn't last long enough or be strong enough)
Again and again
(You said our voices weren't loud enough but we've had enough because)
We want our future back
We want our own mistakes
To take our own path
We wanna do it again

Again and again
(You said we couldn't last long enough or be strong enough)
Again and again
(You said our voices weren't loud enough but we've had enough because)
We want our future back
We want our own mistakes
To take our own path
We wanna do it again and again

Again and again
(You said our voices weren't loud enough but we've had enough because)
We want our future back
We want our own mistakes
To take our own path
We wanna do it again"
"So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
'Cause you can't come back around here
Good goodbye
(Don't you come back no more)


Live from the rhythm, it's
Something wild, venomous
Enemies trying to read me
You're all looking highly illiterate
Blindly forgetting if I'm in the mix
You won't find an equivalent
I've been here killing it
Longer than you've been alive, you idiot
And it makes you so mad
Somebody else could be stepping in front of you
And it makes you so mad that you're not the only one
There's more than one of you
And you can't understand the fact
That it's over and done, hope you had fun
You've got a lot to discuss on the bus
Headed back where you're from


So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
'Cause you can't come back around here
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
Good goodbye


(Wooh!)
Goodbye, good riddance
A period is after every sentence
Did my time with my cellmate
Maxed out so now we finished
Every day was like a hail date
Every night was like a hailstorm
Took her back to my tinted windows
Showin' out, she in rare form
Wings up, now I'm airborne
King Push, they got a chair for him
Make way for the new queen
The old lineup, where they cheer for 'em
Consequence when you ain't there for him
Were you there for him?
Did you care for him?
You were dead wrong


(Don't you come back no more)
So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
'Cause you can't come back around here
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
(Don't you come back no more)
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
(Don't you come back no more)


Yo
Let me say goodbye to my demons
Let me say goodbye to my past life
Let me say goodbye to the darkness
Tell 'em that I'd rather be here in the starlight
Tell 'em that I'd rather be here where they love me
Tell 'em that I'm yours this is our life
And I still keep raising the bar like
Never seen a young black brother in the chart twice
Goodbye to the stereotypes
You can't tell my kings we can't
Mandem we're linking tings in parks
Now I got a tune with Linkin Park
Like goodbye to my old hoeâs
Goodbye to the cold roads
I can't die for my postcode
Young little Mike from the Gold Coast
And now I'm inside with my bro bro's
Gang


So say goodbye and hit the road
Pack it up and disappear
You better have some place to go
'Cause you can't come back around here
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
(Don't you come back no more)
Good goodbye
Good goodbye
(Don't you come back no more)"

Cookin' raw with the Brooklyn boy
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
Uh, uh, uh, uh, yeah! Now, what the hell are you waitin' for?
After me, there shall be no more
So for one last time, nigga, make some noise


Get 'em Jay!


Who you know fresher than Hov'? Riddle me that!
The rest of y'all know where I'm lyrically at
Can't none of y'all mirror me back
Yeah, hearin' me rap is like hearin' G. Rap in his prime
I'm Young H.O., rap's grateful dead
'Bout to take over the globe, now break bread
I'm in Boeing jets, Global Express
Out the country but the blueberry still connect
On the low but the yacht got a triple deck
But when you young, what the fuck you expect? Yep, yep!
Grand openin', grand closin'
God damn, your man Hov' cracked the can open again
Who you gon' find doper than him with no pen
Just draw off inspiration
Soon you gon' see you can't replace (him him)
With cheap imitations for these generations!

Look what you made me do, look what I made for you
Knew if I paid my dues, how will they pay you?
When you first come in the game, they try to play you
Then you drop a couple of hits, look how they wave to you
From Marcy to Madison Square
To the only thing that matters in just a matter of years (yeah)
As fate would have it, Jay's status appears
To be at an all-time high, perfect time to say goodbye
When I come back like Jordan
Wearing the 4-5, it ain't to play games with you
It's to aim at you, probably maim you
If I owe you I'm blowin' you to smithereens
Cocksucker, take one for your team
And I need you to remember one thing (one thing)
I came, I saw, I conquered
From record sales, to sold out concerts
So, motherfucker, if you want this encore
I need you to scream, 'til your lungs get sore


I'm tired of being what you want me to be
Feeling so faithless, lost under the surface
Don't know what you're expecting of me
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
And every second I waste is more than I can take!

I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
Become so tired, so much more aware
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
Is be more like me and be less like you
I've become so numb


Can I get an encore? Do you want more? (more, more, more)
I've become so numb
So for one last time I need y'all to roar
One last time I need y'all to roar"

Everything has to end
You'll soon find that we're out of time left to watch in all unwind
Everything falls apart

I've lied to you
This is the last smile that I'll fake for the sake of being with you
Everything falls apart even
Even the people who never frown eventually break down
Everything has to end
You'll soon find we're out of time left to watch it all unwind
The sake of being with you
Everything falls apart

Why I stay
When you just push away
No matter what you see
You're still so blind to me

I've tried, like you, to do everything you wanted to
This is the last time
That I'll take the blame for the sake of being with you

The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
Everything has to end
You'll soon find we're out of time left to watch it all unwind
The sacrifice is never knowing

Why I stay
When you just push away
No matter what you see
You're still so blind to me

Reverse psychology is failing miserably
It's so hard to be left all alone
Telling you is the only chance for me
There is nothing left but to turn and face you
When I look into your eyes there's nothing there to see
Nothing but my own mistakes staring back at me
Asking why
The sacrifice of hiding in a lie
The sacrifice is never knowing

You're still so blind to me

Why I stay

No matter what you see

"Day by, knowing I'm all alone
White lies, lining up on their own
You said you would stand on my side
Regret, it's too late to deny

All the back and forth and yes and no
All the right and wrong and high and low
And you set me up to let me down
But it all comes back around

What are you worth now?
What are you waiting for?
When every battlefield you run from generates a war?
What are you chasing?
What do you think you deserve?
Cause you will never have a thing
Unless you've got your worth
What are you worth?

Last straw as the sky turns to red
Free fall, while I fight to forget

All the back and forth and yes and no
All the right and wrong and high and low
And you set me up to let me down

Can I help you not to hurt anymore?

There are things that we can have but can't keep

Who cares if one more light goes out
In the sky of a million stars?
It flickers, flickers
Who cares when someone's time runs out
If a moment is all we are?
Or quicker, quicker
Who cares if one more light goes out?
Well, I do

The reminders pull the floor from your feet
In the kitchen one more chair than you need
Oh
And you're angry, and you should be, it's not fair
Just 'cause you can't see it, doesn't mean it isn't there

Yo, what's up?

Later"
"Nothing ever stops all these thoughts and the pain attached to them
Sometimes I wonder why this is happening
It's like nothing I could do will distract me when
I think of how I shot myself in the back again

'Cause from the infinite words I could say
I put all the pain you gave to me on display
But didn't realize instead of setting it free
I took what I hated and made it a part of me

It never goes away
It never goes away


And now you've become a part of me
You'll always be right here
You've become a part of me
You'll always be my fear
I can't separate
Myself from what I've done
Giving up a part of me
I've let myself become you


Hearing your name, the memories come back again
I remember when it started happening
I'd see you in every thought I had and then
The thoughts slowly found words attached to them

And I knew as they escaped away
I was committing myself to them and everyday
I regret saying those things 'cause now I see
That I took what I hated and made it a part of me

It never goes away
It never goes away


And now you've become a part of me
You'll always be right here
You've become a part of me
You'll always be my fear
I can't separate
Myself from what I've done
Giving up a part of me
I've let myself become you


Never goes away
Never goes away
It never goes away
It never goes away

(Get away from me)
Give me my space back you gotta just (go)
Everything comes down to memories of (you)
I've kept it in but now I'm letting you (know)
I've let you go so get away from (me)
Give me my space back you gotta just (go)
Everything comes down to memories of (you)
I've kept it in but now I'm letting you (know)
I've let you go


And now you've become a part of me
You'll always be right here
You've become a part of me
You'll always be my fear

Myself from what I've done
Giving up a part of me

I've let myself become you
I've let myself become lost inside these thoughts of you
Giving up a part of me
I've let myself become you"
"I'm dancing with my demons
I'm hanging off the edge
Storm clouds gather beneath me
Waves break above my head
Head-first hallucination

I wanna fall wide awake now
You tell me it's alright
Tell me I'm forgiven, tonight
But nobody can save me now
I'm holding up a light
Chasing out the darkness inside
'Cause nobody can save me

Stared into this illusion
For answers yet to come
I chose a false solution
But nobody proved me wrong
Head-first hallucination

I wanna fall wide awake
Watch the ground giving way now
You tell me it's alright
Tell me I'm forgiven, tonight
But nobody can save me now
I'm holding up a light
I'm chasing out the darkness inside
'Cause nobody can save me

Been searching somewhere out there
For what's been missing right here (I wanna fall wide awake now)
I've been searching somewhere out there
For what's been missing right here

I wanna fall wide awake now
So tell me it's alright
Tell me I'm forgiven, tonight
And only I can save me now
I'm holding up a light
Chasing out the darkness inside
And I don't wanna let you down
But only I can save me!

Been searching somewhere out there
For what's been missing right here"
"You've been faking it all this time,
You left my trust on the firing line.
As the promises break
The only mistake's
Giving you what was mine.

Your words are clear but their meaning's gone.
The notes are right but the tuning's wrong.
And when you tell me again
That I should give in
I can only take it so long long long long

Ah!
You're terrified, terrified
You'd rather throw it all away, all away,
All away! You're terrified, terrified
You'd rather throw it all away!

Fear is dancing inside your lies
Exposing secrets that you've disguised
And I'm biting my tongue
As you become
Victim of a compromise

'Cause I know who you really are
Not a scratch where you pretend you're scarred
And it's time that you see
The truth about me
I can only get you so far far far far

Ah!
You're terrified, terrified
You'd rather throw it all away, all away,
All away! You're terrified, terrified
You'd rather throw it all away!

Throw it all away, all away way
Throw it all away, all away, all away way
Throw it all away, all away, all away way
Throw it all away, all away, all away way
Throw it all away, all a--

Ah!
You're terrified, terrified
You'd rather throw it all away, all away,
All away, you're terrified, terrified
All away! You're terrified, terrified
You'd rather throw it all away, all away,
All away, you're terrified, terrified
All away! You're terrified, terrified
You'd rather throw it all away, all away
All away, you're terrified, terrified
All away! You're terrified, terrified
You'd rather throw it all away!"
"Turn my mic up louder I got to say something
Lightweights step it aside when we come in

Feel it in your chest the syllables get pumping
People on the street they panic and start running

Words on loose leaf sheet complete coming
I jump in my mind and summon the rhyme, I'm dumping

Healing the blind I promise to let the sun in
Sick of the dark ways we march to the drumming

Jump when they tell us that they wanna see jumping
Fuck that I wanna see some fists pumping

Risk something, take back what's yours
Say something that you know they might attack you for

Cause I'm sick of being treated like I have before
Like it's stupid standing for what I'm standing for

Like this war's really just a different brand of war
Like it doesn't cater to rich and abandon poor

Like they understand you in the back of the jet
When you can't put gas in your tank

And these fuckers are laughing their way to the bank and cashing the cheque
Asking you to have compassion and have some respect

For a leader so nervous in an obvious way
Stuttering and mumbling for nightly news to replay

And the rest of the world watching at the end of the day
In their living room laughing like ""What did he say?""

Amen [5x]

In my living room watching but I am not laughing
Cause when it gets tense I know what might happen

The world is cold, the bold men take action
Have to react or get blown into fractions

Ten years old it's something to see
Another kid my age drugged under a jeep

Taken and bound and found later under a tree
I wonder if he had thought the next one could be me

Do you see the soldiers they're out today?
They brush the dust from bullet-proof vests away

It's ironic at times like this you pray
But a bomb blew the mosque up yesterday

There's bombs on the buses, bikes, roads
Inside your market, your shops, your clothes

My dad: he's got a lot of fear I know
But enough pride inside not to let that show

My brother had a book, he would hold with pride
A little red cover with a broken spine

On the back he hand-wrote a quote inside,
""When the rich wage war it's the poor who die.""

Meanwhile, the leader just talks away
Stuttering and mumbling for nightly news to replay

And the rest of the world watching at the end of the day
Both scared and angry like ""What did he say?""

Amen [6x]

[6x]
(Amen) With hands held high into a sky so blue
(Amen) As the ocean opens up to swallow you"
"Looked in the ocean
Looked in the sea
Found her laughing
Watching for me
Left the door open
Left the door wide
As she often
Kept it inside

And if you're badder than fact phone z
Phend it back to me
Sitting front pitter badder than b
Even badder than phint to phone badder
Than the patter in friends
Who gutter the prat
The Friday on the patter you plumped
You're getting thrown even badder than bomb
Don't trust
If you don't, than your fighting for what?

[2x]
We're fighting for a place
That we can call home
Looking for a way
Not to be alone

Not to be alone

Dun na na
Dun na na na na na na na

Hey, Mike, whatâs up?
This is Ron, Riff Raff, just asking you whatâs happening?
I was just touching base, seeing how your Easter went
Um, just seeing if youâre going to see Joe sometime soon, too,
Because heâs got my keyboard that Iâve been trying to get back
Iâve been trying to call him and he hasnât been returning any messages
So Iâm seeing what the best angle is to, you know, get it back"
"Back, before I said goodbye,
Just as the first day turned to night,
Just as the concrete turned to dust,
And the steel turned into rust,
All I could think was a new way to dig through the damage,
Couldn't think of a way to get through this,
Now I see you taking advantage,
And I find another reason to do this.

I'm digging us a hole to travel through,
I wanna find a way to rattle you,
You wanna try to hear the thunder hit,
You're gonna have to follow me under it.
Let go, it's begun,
Close your eyes, I'm not done,
Breathe a word, and waste your breath,
And keep it up 'til there's nothing left.

Now, that I said goodbye,
Just as the darkness turned to light,
Just as the next light turns to day,
And the world gets underway,
All I can see is the anticipation,
Waiting to take this out on the wind and the raindrops,
And I waited patiently taking it in,
Ready for the first of the face offs.

I'm digging us a hole to travel through,
I wanna find a way to rattle you,
You wanna try to hear the thunder hit,
You're gonna have to follow me under it.

Made me so much more afraid
Just too scared of what I'd find
To look behind, to look behind

All these things I could not say
Made me so much more afraid
Just too scared of what I'd find
To look behind, to look behind

If you go, there's no turning back

"Memories consume
Like opening the wound
I'm picking me apart again
You all assume
I'm safe here in my room
Unless I try to start again

I don't want to be the one
The battles always choose
'Cause inside I realize
That I'm the one confused

I don't know what's worth fighting for
Or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate
And say what I don't mean
I don't know how I got this way
I know it's not alright
So I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit tonight

Clutching my cure
I tightly lock the door
I try to catch my breath again
I hurt much more
Than anytime before
I had no options left again

I don't want to be the one
The battles always choose
'Cause inside I realize
That I'm the one confused

I don't know what's worth fighting for
Or why I have to scream
I don't know why I instigate
And say what I don't mean
I don't know how I got this way
I'll never be alright
So I'm breaking the habit
I'm breaking the habit tonight

I'll paint it on the walls
'Cause I'm the one at fault
I'll never fight again
And this is how it ends

I don't know what's worth fighting for
Or why I have to scream
But now I have some clarity
To show you what I mean
I don't know how I got this way
I'll never be alright

Past the black where the sirens sing
(Warm) Warm me up in the nova's glow
And drop me down to the dream below (low low low)

'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass
Hardly anything there for you to see

For you to see
For you to see
For you to see
For you to see
For you to see

'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass
Hardly anything there for you to see
'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass

"Hey, yo
When this first started off
It was just Linkin Park
And then in the middle
Came Motion Man
And at the end of it all
It was Kutmasta Kurt
With a remix


One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme when I was obsessed with time
All I know, time was just slipping away
And I watched it count down to the end of the day
Watched it watch me and the words that I say
The echo of the clock rhythm in my veins
I know that I didn't look out below
When I watched the time go right out the window
Trying to grab hold
Trying not to watch
I wasted it all on the hands of the clock
But in the end, no matter what I pretend
The journey is more important than the end or the start
And what it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when I tried so hard


I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter


Hey, yo
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind
I designed this rhyme to explain in due time
All I know, hah, I so-socialize
Like the host of the party
I spoke, shake, and made eye contact
Partied and toast strong, all night
Northeast, Southwest coast
I'm staring out the window
No oppourtunity to mingle
I tried to sew it up to weaken your system
I had you throwing up
I brought you back into things
Like the imaginary man of your dreams
Youâd always seem to make it worth it
I pig-skin, I never nerf it
You felt like loving, never played real
Iâm bringing the pleasure
By any means it means Iâm leaving your team
Hell of a team, man it seems I tried so hard


I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter

One thing, I don't know how
It doesn't even matter when you look at it now
'Cause when I designed this rhyme
I was scared of it all, scared to fall, and I hadn't even tried to crawl
But I was forced to run with you mocking me, stopping me, backstabbing me constantly
Remembering all the times you fought with me
Watch the clock now chock-full of hypocrisy
But now your mouth wishes it could inhale
Every single little thing you said to make things fail
Every single word you sputtered just to get your piece
But it really doesn't matter to me
'Cause from the start to the end, no matter what I pretend
The journey is more important than the end or the start
And what it meant to me will eventually be a memory of a time when I tried so hard


I tried so hard
And got so far
But in the end
It doesn't even matter
I had to fall
To lose it all
But in the end
It doesn't even matter


In the end"
"Part of me won't go away
Every day reminded how much I hate it
Weighted against the consequences
Can't live without it so it's senseless
Wanna cut it out of my soul
And just live with a gaping hole
Take control of my life
And wash out all the burnt taste
I made the problems in the first place
Hang my head low 'cause it's part of me
Ya hardly see right next to the heart of me
Hurting me, the wounds soon scar
New cuts cover where the old ones are
And now I'm sick of this
I can't stand the sandpaper thoughts that grate on my sanity
I rather not even be than the man that's staring in the mirror through me

[4x]
Cut myself free willingly
Stop just what's killing me


I feel it every day
I feel I made my way
I feel it swell up inside, swell up inside
Swallowing me


Freedom can be frightening if you've never felt it
Once it's been dealt with you feel like you've been touched by something angelic
And then melted down into a pool of peace
Cease to be the animal you used to be
Remove the broken parts you know were wrong
And feel the calm when the problem's all gone
And then you start to see
Another piece of yourself that you can't let be
Memories of the last fight to free yourself
Take it to the depths of the bottom of the well
And now you know that you can choose to lose
The part in your heart where your insides bruised
You can live if you're willing to
Put a stop to just what's killing you

[4x]
Cut myself free willingly
Stop just what's killing me


I feel it every day
I feel I made my way
I feel it swell up inside, swell up inside
Swallowing me

[2x]
Alive in me
Inside of me
A part turns grey
And rots away silently

This part of me won't go away
Part of me won't go away

[2x]
Everywhere I look around
I see how everything ought to be
Every time I see myself
I see there's always something wrong with me

[2x]
I feel it every day
I feel I made my way
I feel it swell up inside, swell up inside
Swallowing me

[2x]
I feel it swell up inside, swell up inside
Swallowing me"
"""I come to this magnificent house of worship tonight because my conscience leaves me no other choice.

A true revolution of values will lay hand on the world order and say of war, ""This way of settling differences is not just."" This business of burning human beings with napalm, of filling our nation's homes with orphans and widows, of injecting poisonous drugs of hate into the veins of peoples normally humane, of sending men home from dark and bloody battlefields physically handicapped and psychologically deranged, cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice and love.""

Take me down to the fighting end
Wash the poison from off my skin
Show me how to be whole again

Warm me up in a nova's glow
And drop me down to the dream below

'Cause I'm only a crack in this castle of glass
Hardly anything there for you to see

"Don't start with the ugly part
Don't end with the things that will make them want to walk away
Tune in at the din again
Another price ain't cheap but somebody's gonna have to pay

Oh yes, you can only guess
What it is, what it was, don't remember what I had in mind
Shotgunning on a joy ride
Coming down the block, half-cocked nearly half the time

Give it back, give it back, give it back, g-g-give it back, sing it

One time for the words divine
And two times for the things that you hope you never have to say
Three scenes in a dead man's dream
And the girls tell the boys that they better fucking run away

Live it up, or g-g-give it up
Turn it up, tune it out, let it rhyme with the other line
Shotgunning on a joy ride
Coming down the block, half-cocked nearly all the time

Give it back, give it back, give it back, g-g-give it back, sing it"
"Your lies!
Yeah


I didn't think that I had a debt to pay
'Til they came to take all I had left away
You said you wouldn't put me to the test today
But I remember you saying that yesterday

There was a time when your mind wasn't out of control
Every memory and confession pouring out of your soul
Like a pill you couldn't swallow and it swallowed you whole
Another lie hard to follow 'til it followed you home and like that


Broken down
A victim of your lies

You hide behind lies
You don't know why
You crossed the line
Wrapped up inside your lies
You hide behind lies
You're lost inside that cold disguise
Behind your lies


I don't know what I thought I might say
Seems like we never were taught the right way
Every other minute I fought for my place
And drop what I made and thought you might stay so

I'm guessing that you probably know
When your inside's hollow then you ought to be cold
Like a pill I couldn't swallow and it swallowed me whole
Another lie hard to follow, 'til it followed me home and like that


Broken down
A victim of your lies

You hide behind lies
You don't know why
You crossed the line
Wrapped up inside your lies

You hide behind lies
You're lost inside that cold disguise
Behind your lies

You're faking, you're mistaken
If you think that you could climb out of this hole
Forsaken, what we take when
All our lies have all the power of control

Broken down
A victim of your lies

You hide behind lies
You don't know why
You hide behind lies
You don't know why
You hide behind lies
You don't know why
You hide behind
Wrapped up inside your lies

You hide behind lies
You don't know why
You crossed the line
Wrapped up inside your lies
You hide behind lies
You're lost inside that cold disguise
Behind your lies"

Thank you for comin' out tonight
You coulda been anywhere in the world, but you're here with us
We appreciate that


H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Fo' shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in VA
Was herbin' em in the home of the Terrapins
Got it dirt cheap for them
Plus if they was short with cheese I would work with them
Boy and we got rid of that dirt for them
Wasn't born hustlers, I was birthing 'em
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Fo' sheezy my neezy keep my arms so breezy
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me
Haters want me clapped and chromed it ain't easy
Cops wanna knock me, D.A. wanna box me in
But somehow, I beat them charges like Rocky
H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Not guilty, he who does not feel me is not real to me
Therefore he doesn't exist
So poof... vamoose son of a bitch

H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
Fo' shizzle my nizzle used to dribble down in VA

Check it out, yo
(It starts with one)
One thing, I don't know why
It doesn't even matter how hard you try
Keep that in mind, I designed this rhyme
To explain in due time
(All I know)
Time is a valuable thing
Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Watch it count down to the end of the day
The clock ticks life away
(And it's so unreal)
I didn't look out below
I watch the time go right out the window
Trying to hold on, and didn't even know
I wasted it all just to
(Watch you go)
I kept everything inside
And even though I tried
It all fell apart
What it meant to me
Will eventually
Be a memory
Of a time when I tried, so


H to the izz-O, V to the izz-A
LP, Jay-Z, help me out
Oh, they havin' good old time out there
It starts with

"[2x]
From the top to the bottom
Bottom to top I stop
At the core I've forgotten
In the middle of my thoughts
Taken far from my safety
The picture is there
The memory won't escape me
But why should I care

There's a place so dark you can't see the end
Skies cock back and shock that which can't defend
The rain then sends dripping acidic questions
Forcefully, the power of suggestion

Then with the eyes shut looking through the rust and rotten dust
A small spot of light floods the floor
And pours over the rusted world of pretend
And the eyes ease open and it's dark again

From the top to the bottom
Bottom to top I stop
At the core I've forgotten
In the middle of my thoughts
Taken far from my safety
The picture is there
The memory won't escape me
But why should I care

In the memory you'll find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up

Moving all around
Screaming of the ups and downs
Pollution manifested in perpetual sound
The wheels go 'round
And the sunset creeps behind
Street lamps, chain-link and concrete

A little piece of paper with a picture drawn floats
On down the street 'til the wind is gone
And the memory now is like the picture was then
When the paper's crumpled up it can't be perfect again

[2x]
From the top to the bottom
Bottom to top I stop
At the core I've forgotten
In the middle of my thoughts
Taken far from my safety
The picture is there
The memory won't escape me
But why should I care

In the memory you'll find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up

[7x]
Now you got me caught in the act
You bring the thought back
Telling you
That I see it right through you

[2x]
In the memory you'll find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up"
"I am a little bit of loneliness, a little bit of disregard
Handful of complaints, but I can't help the fact that everyone can see these scars
I am what I want you to want, what I want you to feel
But it's like no matter what I do, I can't convince you, to just believe this is real

So I let go watching you, turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that I'm not
But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I got


I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored


I am a little bit insecure, a little unconfident
'Cause you don't understand I do what I can but sometimes I don't make sense
I am what you never wanna say, but I've never had a doubt
It's like no matter what I do I can't convince you for once just to hear me out

So I let go watching you, turn your back like you always do
Face away and pretend that I'm not
But I'll be here 'cause you're all that I've got


I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored

Now
Hear me out now
You're gonna listen to me, like it or not
Right now
Hear me out now
You're gonna listen to me, like it or not
Right now

I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored

I can't feel the way I did before
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored
Time won't heal this damage anymore
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored

I can't feel
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored
Time won't heal
Don't turn your back on me
I won't be ignored"
"From the top to the bottom
Bottom to top I stop
At the core I've forgotten
In the middle of my thoughts
Taken far from my safety
The picture's there
The memory won't escape me

We're stuck in a place so dark
You can hardly see
The manner of matter that splits with the words I breathe
And as the rain drips acidic questions around me
I block out the sight of the powers that be
And duck away into the darkness
Times up
I wind up in a rusted world with eyes shut so tight that it blurs into the world of pretend
And the eyes ease open
And it's dark again

From the top to the bottom
Bottom to top I stop
At the core I've forgotten
In the middle of my thoughts
Taken far from my safety
The picture's there
The memory won't escape me
But why should I care?

In the memory you'll find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up

Listen to the sound
Dizzy from the ups and downs
I'm nauseated by the polluted rot that's all around
Watching the wheels of cars that pass
I look past to the last of the light and the long shadows it casts
A window grows and captures the eye
And cries out a yellow light as it passes me by
And a young shadowy figure sits in front of a box
Inside a building of rock with antennas on top, now
Nothing can stop in this land of the pain
The sane lose not knowing they were part of the game
And while the insides change
The box stays the same and the figure inside could bear anybody's name
The memories I keep are from a time like then
I put on my paper so I could come back to them
Someday I'm hoping to close my eyes and pretend
That this crumpled up paper can be perfect again

Yo, from the top to the bottom
Bottom to top I stop
At the core I've forgotten
In the middle of my thoughts
Taken far from my safety
The picture's there
The memory won't escape me

I'm here at this podium talking
The ceremonial offerings dedicated to urban dysfunctional offspring
What's happening?
City governments are eternally napping
Trapped in greedy covenants
Causing urban collapsing
Bullets that scar souls with dark holes
Get more than your car stole, some parts be blacker than charcoal, for real
This society's deprivation depends not on our differences but the separation within
No preparation is made
Limited aid, minimum wage
Living in a tenement cage where rent isn't paid
Tragedy within a parade
The darkness overspreads like a permanent plague
I'm the forgotten

In the memory you'll find me
Eyes burning up
The darkness holding me tightly
Until the sun rises up"
"I'm swimming in the smoke
Of bridges I have burned
So don't apologize
I'm losing what I don't deserve

The blame is mine alone
For bridges I have burned
So don't apologize
I'm losing what I don't deserve
What I don't deserve"
"Like shining oil this night is dripping down
Stars are slipping down, glistening
And I'm trying not to think what I'm leaving now
No deceiving now
It's time you let me know
Let me know

When the lights go out and we open our eyes
Out there in the silence
I'll be gone
I'll be gone
Let the sun fade out and another one rise
Climbing through tomorrow
I'll be gone
I'll be gone

This air between us is getting thinner now
Into winter now
Bitter-sweet
And 'cross that horizon this sun is setting down
You're forgetting now
It's time you let me go
Let me go

When the lights go out and we open our eyes
Out there in the silence
I'll be gone
I'll be gone
Let the sun fade out and another one rise
Climbing through tomorrow
I'll be gone
I'll be gone

And tell them I couldn't help myself
And tell them I was alone
Oh, tell me I am the only one
And there's nothing that can stop me

When the lights go out and we open our eyes
Out there in the silence
I'll be gone
I'll be gone
Let the sun fade out and another one rise
Climbing through tomorrow
I'll be gone
I'll be gone
I'll be gone"
"I'm standing in the middle of it, middle of it, middle of it

Yo, y'all better wake up, you think we don't see y'all drifting?
Sleeping on the job and forgetting your position (position)?
Sit straight and listen what you are missing
I cook up a batch, hot straight out the kitchen

No indecision, I spit right
Heavy as a fist fight
No gloves and no masks
No pain and no slack
No way to look back

Nobody to say, I can't make my own path
'Cause the way that y'all act, I wanna break something
Comin' at me like the pain I feel means nothing
Comin' from a place where you can't relate

Where every word from your face comes across as fake
And I can hardly take the way that y'all treat us
Sending this out to anyone who won't believe us
Spelling it out so y'all know the deal
And if you can't feel it, maybe you can't feel


I'm standing in the middle of it, middle of it, middle of it
Man, who are you?
I'm standing in the middle of it, middle of it, middle of it
What are you saying?

I'm standing in the middle of it, middle of it, middle of it
What are you writing?
I'm standing in the middle of it, middle of it, middle of it
Man, who are you?

Tell 'em, Motion


Eat your words
Say what you used to say and act how you used to act
Every time you heard my occupation was a rap attack (rap attack)
My conversation's stacked, I switch my defense on you

Every time you want to get deep, you'll see my knuckle package
Born to die, ferocious MC make you go back and write your rhymes
My style chokes up like a little league baseball player
It moves, I'm strangling as I'm swinging as main mangler

I wanna D4, poach you as your seafood is C4
I'm gonna rap and you still knee-high
Y'all wanna train with me, guy? Man, it's destructive
Man, it's like jabs from boxing champ Lennox

Perfect for your head, I'll fit it like New Era hats
That top off suits, B-boy etiquette
Express myself with my hang-side
Then I extend one finger, the middle to fucking all crowds


I'm standing in the middle of it, middle of it, middle of it
Man, who are you?
I'm standing in the middle of it, middle of it, middle of it
What are you sayin'?

I'm standing in the middle of it, middle of it, middle of it
What are you writin'?
I'm standing in the middle of it, middle of it, middle of it
Man, who are you?


Yo, Motion
(Yeah?)
Sometimes I feel it's like nothing that I ever do is ever good enough
(For real)
Like I should stop and go back to L.A


Back away where I know, I won't be seen
And nobody's gonna critique the music that I make
And mistake me for some fucking kid with a backpack
Rapping on a track just to make a buck

For a mix-tape that sucks
And DJs that don't get it
But I been down that road and I know
People don't wanna go where I might go

Don't wanna know what it's like
To step outside your zone with a mic
Just controlling the hype
And if we need to take shots from them
And be stopped by them just to meet these ends
Then so be it, I will not hold my breath
I'm gonna spit 'til I got none left
Motion, where you at?


I'm standing in the middle of it, middle of it, middle of it
Man, who are you?
I'm standing in the middle of it, middle of it, middle of it
What are you sayin'?

I'm standing in the middle of it, middle of it, middle of it

I'm standing in the middle of it, middle of it, middle of it

"I dreamed I was missing
You were so scared
But no one would listen
'Cause no one else cared

After my dreaming
I woke with this fear
What am I leaving
When I'm done here?

So if you're asking me
I want you to know

When my time comes
Forget the wrong that I've done
Help me leave behind some
Reasons to be missed
And don't resent me
And when you're feeling empty
Keep me in your memory
Leave out all the rest
Leave out all the rest

Don't be afraid
I've taken my beating
I've shared what I've made
I'm strong on the surface
Not all the way through
I've never been perfect
But neither have you

So if you're asking me
I want you to know

When my time comes
Forget the wrong that I've done
Help me leave behind some
Reasons to be missed
Don't resent me
And when you're feeling empty
Keep me in your memory
Leave out all the rest
Leave out all the rest

Forgetting all the hurt inside
You've learned to hide so well
Pretending someone else can come
And save me from myself
I can't be who you are

When my time comes
Forget the wrong that I've done
Help me leave behind some
Reasons to be missed
Don't resent me

"I used the deadwood to make the fire rise
The blood of innocence burning in the skies
I filled my cup with the rising of the sea
And poured it out in an ocean of debris

I'm swimming in the smoke
Of bridges I have burned
So don't apologize
I'm losing what I don't deserve
What I don't deserve

We held our breath when the clouds began to form
But you were lost in the beating of the storm
And in the end we were made to be apart
Like separate chambers of the human heart

I'm swimming in the smoke
Of bridges I have burned
So don't apologize
I'm losing what I don't deserve

It's in the blackened bones
Of bridges I have burned
So don't apologize
I'm losing what I don't deserve
What I don't deserve

I'm swimming in the smoke
Of bridges I have burned
So don't apologize
I'm losing what I don't deserve

"This is my December
This is my time of the year
This is my December
This is all so clear

This is my December
This is my snow-covered home
This is my December
This is me alone

And I
Just wish that I didn't feel
Like there was something I missed
And I
Take back all the things I said
To make you feel like that
And I
Just wish that I didn't feel
Like there was something I missed
And I
Take back the things I ever said to you...

And I'd give it all away
Just to have somewhere to go to
Give it all away
To have someone to come home to

This is my December
These are my snow-covered trees
This is me pretending
This is all I need

And I
Just wish that I didn't feel
Like there was something I missed
And I
Take back all the things I said
To make you feel like that
And I
Just wish that I didn't feel
Like there was something I missed
And I
Take back the things I ever said to you...

And I'd give it all away
Just to have somewhere to go to
Give it all away
To have someone to come home to

This is my December
This is my time of the year
This is my December
This is all so clear

Give it all away
Just to have somewhere to go to
Give it all away
To have someone to come home to

Give it all away
Just to have somewhere to go to
Give it all away
To have someone to come home to"
"Separate
Sifting through the wreckage
I can't concentrate
Searching for a message
In the fear and pain
Broken down and waiting
For the chance to feel alive

Now in my remains
Are promises that never came
Set the silence free
To wash away the worst of me

Come apart
Falling in the cracks
Of every broken heart
Digging through the wreckage
Of your disregard
Sinking down and waiting
For the chance to feel alive

Now in my remains
Are promises that never came
Set the silence free
To wash away the worst of me

Like an army, falling
One by one by one
Like an army, falling
One by one by one
Like an army, falling
One by one by one
Like an army, falling
One by one by one

Now in my remains
Are promises that never came
Set the silence free
To wash away the worst of me

Like an army, falling
One by one by one
Like an army, falling
One by one by one"
"I'd like to introduce [echo fade[
In your [echo]
In your [being scratched]
In your sound institute of invention
And revival of audio weapon systems. 

Let's try [being scratched] 
Let's try something else.

Folks we have a very special guest for you tonight [echo fade]
BREAK IT DOWN! Cut it up! Using the waves of sound. 
A true master paralyzes his opponent
Leaving him vulnerable to attack... 
Mr. Hahn.."
